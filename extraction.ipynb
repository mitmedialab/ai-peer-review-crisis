INTRODUCTION\\nZERO-SUM THINKING approaches policy decisions with the mindset that gains that accrue\\nto some parties necessarily come at the expense of others. A remarkable feature of this\\nworldview is that it manifests even in non zero-sum choices, where one policy is widely\\nregarded to beneﬁt voters on average. For instance, experts see the immigration of skilled\\nlabor as spurring economic growth and innovation, creating a larger tax base, and even\\nleading to greater employment of those native-born through complementarities and ag-\\nglomeration effects.1 Nevertheless, a common refrain against immigration stresses that\\nevery job taken by an immigrant could otherwise have gone to a native. In trade policy,\\neconomists typically emphasize that free trade is mutually beneﬁcial, allowing consumers\\nto obtain goods and services at lower prices (e.g., Sapienza and Zingales (2013)). Yet, pro-\\ntectionist arguments focus on how elites within a country gain at the expense of workers.\\nThis “us versus them” mindset is prominent in populist movements today. Leading up\\nto the Brexit referendum of 2016, the majority of analysts viewed membership in the Eu-\\nropean Union as a “positive-sum” policy and cautioned that leaving would be detrimental\\nto UK workers, consumers, and businesses.2 However, the Leave campaign pointed to the\\nS.

The leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, framed the debate as “a\\ncoalition of the politicians against the people” and declared Brexit to be “a victory for\\nreal people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people....”3 The campaign\\nthus exploited a zero-sum perspective on EU membership to generate support for the\\nreform. Analogously, in his 2016 presidential campaign, the then Republican presidential\\nnominee Donald J. Trump promised to pull the United States out of the Trans-Paciﬁc\\nPartnership, which he asserted was “another disaster done and pushed by special inter-\\nests...”. He fulﬁlled his promise once he became president and viewed his executive order\\nas a “Great thing for the American worker...” Yet, analyses of trade suggest that the TPP\\nwas positive-sum economically and politically (Petri and Plummer (2016)).4\\nAll of the above suggests a puzzle: why does zero-sum thinking prevail even in positive-\\nsum settings in which voters’ interests are largely aligned? Prior work (e.g., Meegan\\n(2010), Chinoy, Nunn, Sequeira, and Stantcheva (2024)) has largely viewed zero-sum\\nthinking as a psychological trait. In contrast, we offer an informational microfoundation\\nthat shows how zero-sum thinking can manifest even with completely rational voters.\\nWe study policy choices in which voters do not know how many and who beneﬁt from\\none policy versus another. We ﬁnd that distributional uncertainty coupled with asymmet-\\nric information gives rise to zero-sum thinking: a voter votes against policies supported by\\nothers out of fear of what their support means for her. We show that this effect can push\\nan electorate overall to support policies contrary to its interests. This mechanism is purely\\nstrategic, emerging independently of identity politics or partisan interests, and even with\\nvoters who are ex ante symmetric.\\nTo see how the strategic mechanism works, consider the following example. Ann, Bella,\\nand Carol vote between policies p∗and p∗, and the policy that obtains more votes wins.\\nEach voter’s payoff from policy p∗is 0. By contrast, policy p∗results in two winners, each\\nof whom accrue a payoff of 2, and one loser, who obtains a payoff of −3. Ex ante, voters\\nare symmetric: there are three equally likely states of the world, {ωA\\x03ωB\\x03ωC}, where ωi\\nis the state in which voter i is the loser.\\nGiven these payoffs, policy p∗would win the election were voters fully informed, that is,\\nto know the state of the world. Being ex ante optimal, that policy would also prevail if all\\nvoters were known to be uninformed, that is, the no-information benchmark.5\\nOur interest is in the setting in which voters may be asymmetrically informed. Suppose\\nthat each voter privately learns her payoff from policy p∗with (independent) probability\\nλ > 0 and otherwise remains uninformed. To illustrate the scope for zero-sum thinking,\\nwe envision that λ is small, which implies that, with high likelihood, all three voters view\\npolicy p∗to be superior. Nevertheless, each voter’s uncertainty about what the other vot-\\ners have learned results in a strict equilibrium that selects policy p∗with high probability.\\nThat equilibrium involves the following behavior:\\n• An informed loser votes p∗and an informed winner votes p∗;\\n• An uninformed voter votes p∗.\\n3See\\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/19/nigel-farage-brexit-party-on-the-road-populism\\nand https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/nigel-farage-basks-in-the-triumph-of-his-new-dawn.\\n4More broadly, pertaining to trade, most estimates show that the US-China trade war that began in 2018\\nhas been costly for the average U.S. household (Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2022)). Autor, Beck, Dorn, and\\nHanson (2024) found that, contrary to the zero-sum perspective, this trade war did not actually increase em-\\nployment of American workers, even in the places where the newly-protected industries were located; however,\\nit strengthened political support for the Republican party, particularly in those areas.\\n5Throughout our analysis, we focus on weakly undominated equilibria.\\n', 'POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ZERO-SUM THINKING\\n43\\nWe explain why this behavior constitutes an equilibrium. As an informed voter votes for\\nher strictly preferred policy, it sufﬁces to consider the incentives of an uninformed voter,\\nsay Ann. Her vote affects her payoff only if it breaks a tie: of Bella and Carol, one votes p∗\\nand the other votes p∗. Given the stipulated behavior, Ann knows that only an informed\\nwinner would vote for p∗. By contrast, the vote for p∗may be cast by an uninformed voter\\n(just like Ann) or an informed loser. For λ ≈0, Ann ascribes much higher probability to\\nthe former event. In this case, she and the other uninformed voter have an equal chance of\\nbeing the remaining winner. Hence, whenever her vote is decisive, Ann believes that she\\nis a winner with probability one-half, lower than the ex ante odds of two-thirds. At these\\ninterim odds, Ann ﬁnds it strictly optimal to vote p∗, ratifying that the strategy proﬁle is a\\nstrict equilibrium.6 That is, when uninformed voters fear that support for policy p∗comes\\nfrom others who are better informed, they ﬁnd it optimal to vote p∗, thereby reinforcing\\nthe initial suspicion.\\nObserve that if λ ≈0, all voters are likely uninformed. As they all vote p∗, that policy\\nwins with near certainty. This outcome contrasts with what prevails in the no-information\\nbenchmark. It also contrasts with what would be chosen if all signals were realized pub-\\nlicly; in that setting, policy p∗would win with near certainty as voters would see that they\\nall are uninformed and therefore vote for the ex ante optimal policy. Hence, both ex ante\\nand with public information, voters have aligned preferences and favor policy p∗.\\nThis example suggests a strategic rationale for the prevalence of zero-sum thinking\\neven in settings where voter preferences are largely aligned. Our analysis evaluates more\\nbroadly when asymmetric information leads to such outcomes. We go beyond the exam-\\nple in several respects, the most important being that our general model allows uncer-\\ntainty about how many voters beneﬁt from the ex ante optimal policy. To isolate the role\\nof asymmetric information, we start with the benchmark in which all voters share the\\nsame information and ex ante preferences; the unique equilibrium (in weakly undomi-\\nnated strategies) then selects the optimal policy. We compare that benchmark with an\\n“informationally-scarce” setting in which each voter obtains additional private informa-\\ntion with a small probability.7 Our analysis evaluates when the prospect of asymmetric\\ninformation leads the electorate astray.\\nAs we show, the question boils down to how an uninformed voter, say Ann, views a\\npolicy when she conditions on others learning that the policy beneﬁts them. Should she\\nsee the good news for others as good or bad news for herself? On one hand, others may\\nreceive good news about a policy because the policy results in many winners, which im-\\nproves her odds of being a winner also. This force of advantageous selection is potent if\\nuncertainty about the number of winners trumps distributional uncertainty, for example,\\nin a pure common-value election where either all voters gain or all lose from a policy. The\\nsecond force is adverse selection: for any given number of winners, Ann’s odds of being\\na winner reduce when others receive good news. This crowding-out effect features in our\\nexample above where the number of winners is ﬁxed.\\n6The probability that Ann is a winner, conditional on being pivotal, is\\n1\\n2−λ , and she has a strict incentive to\\nvote p∗if λ < 1\\n3 .\\n7We focus on informationally-scarce settings for primarily two reasons. Conceptually, this study describes\\nsettings in which voters, being mostly uninformed, agree with high probability on which policy is better. Thus,\\nit homes in on the prospect for zero-sum thinking in positive-sum policy choices. We also view this focus to\\nbe reasonable from the applied perspective that it is often difﬁcult for voters to know or predict the impact\\nof policies. We elaborate on this motivation in Sections 2.2 and 6, and also study a setting with abundant\\ninformation in Section 4.1.\\n', '44\\nS. N. ALI, M. MIHM, AND L. SIGA\\nMore generally, which force dominates hinges on how a voter’s payoff correlates with\\nthe signals of other voters. We call the collective choice problem adversely correlated if the\\nadverse selection effect dominates and otherwise deem it advantageously correlated; each\\nis a condition on primitives. Our main result (Theorem 1) characterizes how correlation\\nshapes equilibrium behavior in informationally-scarce settings. Stated informally, it ﬁnds\\nthat the following holds.\\nMAIN RESULT: If the collective choice problem is adversely correlated, there is a strict equi-\\nlibrium that selects the ex ante inferior policy with near certainty. Otherwise, every equilibrium\\nselects the ex ante optimal policy with near certainty.\\nAdverse correlation is thus a source of political fragility as elections may then select a\\npolicy that would not be chosen were all voters known to be uninformed. The strategic\\nlogic reﬂects zero-sum thinking, whereby a sufﬁciently large group of uninformed voters\\nvote for the inferior policy for fear of what other voters have learned. Not all equilib-\\nria select the inferior policy: there also exists an equilibrium in which the optimal policy\\nwins.8 But, nevertheless, elections may not pick the right outcome and collective choice\\nhinges on voters’ ability to coordinate on a “good” equilibrium. By contrast, if the col-\\nlective choice problem is advantageously correlated, such coordination is obviated; all\\nequilibria—pure or mixed, symmetric or asymmetric—result in the optimal policy.9\\nFor expositional clarity, we consider a model with a ﬁxed number of voters, all of whom\\nare ex ante symmetric, aggregating votes by simple-majority rule. But the strategic ratio-\\nnale for zero-sum thinking applies beyond this setting. Similar results hold for other vot-\\ning rules, imposing a restriction to symmetric equilibria, and with an electorate of random\\nsize. Moreover, ex ante asymmetries only amplify the tendency for zero-sum thinking. We\\nalso show that informational scarcity is not necessary: information can be relatively abun-\\ndant and yet zero-sum thinking may still push the electorate to select the inferior policy\\nwith high probability, even in a large electorate.\\nThe condition of adverse correlation lends itself to comparative statics. We show that\\npolicy choices that are more polarizing, in terms of the proportional loss suffered by losers\\nrelative to the gains that accrue to winners, have a greater potential to induce adverse\\ncorrelation. We also formulate the “crowding-out effect” from learning that others are\\nwinners in terms of the standard likelihood-ratio dominance order. These results reveal\\nfeatures that make elections more prone to zero-sum thinking.\\nOur analysis also identiﬁes informational drivers of zero-sum thinking. If voters were\\nto learn only about aggregate outcomes—in our model, the number of winners, but more\\nbroadly, say, aggregate GDP or economic growth—then the collective choice problem\\ncannot be adversely correlated. By contrast, purely distributional information that identi-\\nﬁes who is ﬁrst in line to obtain gains induces adverse correlation. This contrast dovetails\\nwith analyses of how media outlets proﬁt from selling information that polarizes rather\\nthan uniﬁes voters (Martin and Yurukoglu (2017), Perego and Yuksel (2022)). Our results\\ncall attention to a pernicious “downstream” effect of this market competition on voting\\nbehavior.\\n8For instance, in the example, there also exists an equilibrium in which all uninformed voters vote for p∗.\\n9From this standpoint, our work connects to the growing interest in institutional design under adversarial\\nequilibrium selection, as in Mathevet, Perego, and Taneva (2020), Halac, Lipnowski, and Rappoport (2021),\\nAli, Haghpanah, Lin, and Siegel (2022), Inostroza and Pavan (2024), and others.\\n', 'POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ZERO-SUM THINKING\\n45\\nWe outline the remainder of our paper.

Omitted proofs are in the Appendix and the Supplemental Appendix (Ali, Mihm,\\nand Siga (2024)). The rest of this Introduction places our work within the context of the\\nbroader literature.\\nRelated Literature.\\nThis paper contributes to the understanding of distrust and zero-\\nsum thinking in politics, an issue that has been studied from various perspectives. Re-\\nsearch in social psychology (Meegan (2010), Ró˙zycka-Tran, Boski, and Wojciszke (2015),\\nDavidai and Ongis (2019)) documents the prevalence of zero-sum thinking. Within eco-\\nnomics, Chinoy et al. (2024) found that both Democrat and Republican voters engage in\\nzero-sum thinking, and that those who exhibit a greater tendency to do so also support\\nmore redistribution and stricter immigration controls.10 While this body of work largely\\nviews zero-sum thinking as a psychological trait, we provide a complementary perspec-\\ntive that shows how this worldview emerges in settings in which rational voters worry that\\nothers have an informational advantage. A beneﬁt of our approach is that it sheds light\\non features of a policy choice that moderate or amplify the tendency to see the world in\\nzero-sum terms.\\nZero-sum thinking is closely connected to polarization and populism. Research on po-\\nlarization, surveyed by Iyengar, Lelkes, Levendusky, Malhotra, and Westwood (2019),\\nshows that supporters of each U.S. political party distrust members of the other party,\\nreﬂecting potentially both partisan animus and the perception that policies advanced by\\none party are detrimental to the other. Furthermore, the work on false polarization (e.g.,\\nLevendusky and Malhotra (2016)) documents that voters overestimate their degree of\\npolarization. Porting that ﬁnding to our context suggests that even if a collective choice\\nproblem is advantageously correlated, voters might incorrectly perceive it to be adversely\\ncorrelated, which would magnify the scope for zero-sum thinking. Populism also features\\nzero-sum thinking given that one of its deﬁning characteristics is “anti-elitism” (Mudde\\n(2004), Guriev and Papaioannou (2022)). Our baseline model does not distinguish be-\\ntween elite and non-elite voters, but our extension in Section 5.3 shows that these distinc-\\ntions only amplify the strategic forces in our model. Numerous studies model populism,\\nthrough the channel of signaling (Acemoglu, Egorov, and Sonin (2013)), identity poli-\\ntics (Bonomi, Gennaioli, and Tabellini (2021)), inequality aversion (Pástor and Veronesi\\n(2021)), or misspeciﬁed beliefs (Eliaz and Spiegler (2020), Levy, Razin, and Young (2022),\\nSzeidl and Szucs (2024)). Our model offers a complementary perspective, showing that\\nasymmetric information may spur completely rational voters to distrust each other even\\nin settings where interests are largely aligned.\\nFernandez and Rodrik (1991), an important precursor, showed that a reform that ben-\\neﬁts a majority of voters ex post may nevertheless fail ex ante if the expected payoff from\\nthe resulting lottery is not worthwhile for a majority of voters. Their model does not\\nfeature asymmetric information nor aggregate uncertainty about the number of winners;\\n10Ali, Mihm, Siga, and Tergiman (2021) also found evidence suggestive of zero-sum thinking in that across\\na range of experimental treatments on adverse and advantageous selection, subjects distrust better-informed\\npartners who have conﬂicting interests but fail to trust those with aligned interests. Bergeron, Carvalho, Hen-\\nrich, Nunn, and Weigel (2024) used an evolutionary model to show that zero-sum interactions lead to belief\\nsystems that demotivate effort.\\n', '46\\nS. N. ALI, M. MIHM, AND L. SIGA\\nroughly put, the reasoning reﬂects zero-sum thinking in a zero-sum setting. In their set-\\nting, the ex ante optimal policy always wins. We show that asymmetric information ampli-\\nﬁes the scope for political failures. The fear of what other voters have learned leads voters\\nto choose a policy they deem ex ante inferior, that is, zero-sum thinking in a positive-sum\\nsetting.\\nOur work also contributes to the literature on the “swing voter’s curse,” which studies\\nhow voting behavior is inﬂuenced by asymmetric information. Feddersen and Pesendorfer\\n(1996) showed that, if voter interests are completely aligned, an uninformed voter might\\nstrategically abstain so as to leave the decision to better informed voters.11 In our analysis,\\nthe potential for misaligned interests implies that an uninformed voter might not defer to\\nand, a fortiori, might wish to act against those who are better informed.12 A few papers\\nin this literature (Kim and Fey (2007), Bhattacharya (2013), Acharya (2016)) show that\\nmisaligned interests could disrupt information aggregation in large elections, assuming\\nvoter types are conditionally independent.13 While our work and theirs share some com-\\nmon threads, our focus on distributional considerations and zero-sum thinking requires a\\nsetup in which voters’ type is inherently correlated. Our results also speak to the robust-\\nness and fragility of collective choice to asymmetric information rather than information\\naggregation per se. By highlighting how zero-sum thinking makes collective choice fragile,\\nour analysis offers a complementary perspective on how asymmetric information shapes\\nvoting behavior.\\nOur interest in fragility connects to the study of global games and higher-order beliefs\\n(Carlsson and van Damme (1993), Kajii and Morris (1997)). Closer to our work, Morris\\nand Song Shin (2012) found that small amounts of private information can disrupt asset\\nmarkets through adverse selection. While related, the fragility modeled in this literature\\ndeparts from that which we study. Prior work shows that higher-order uncertainty renders\\nsome equilibrium outcomes of complete information games untenable in nearby incom-\\nplete information games; that is, the equilibrium outcome correspondence is not lower\\nhemicontinuous. By contrast, we ﬁnd that incomplete information games with scarce pri-\\nvate information generate equilibrium outcomes that do not obtain in the complete infor-\\nmation game. Formally, the outcome correspondence of weakly undominated equilibria\\nis not upper hemicontinuous. As we show, second-order uncertainty alone triggers this\\ndiscontinuity.\\n2. MODEL\\n2.1. Setup\\nThe Collective Choice Problem.\\nA group of voters N :={1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n}uses simple-majority\\nrule to choose between two policies, p∗and p∗. For simplicity, we assume that n is odd so\\nthat policy p wins with strictly more than τ := n−1\\n2 votes.\\n11They also modeled settings in which one policy might enjoy greater support from “partisan” dominant-\\naction types. They showed that “independent” uninformed voters might counter that partisan bias by tilting\\ntheir votes toward the other policy. In this way, their analysis could rationalize uninformed voters voting for\\na policy they deem inferior based on all that they know. Austen-Smith and Banks (1996) and Feddersen and\\nPesendorfer (1998) modeled similar effects in pure common-value settings in which, given the prior beliefs,\\nthe voting rule tilts in favor of one policy.\\n12Formally, under adverse correlation, the equilibrium that we construct in Theorem 1 would remain even\\nif voters could abstain.\\n13The literature also studies other obstacles to information aggregation; see, for instance, Feddersen and\\nPesendorfer (1997), Razin (2003), Ekmekci and Lauermann (2020), and Barelli, Bhattacharya, and Siga (2022).\\n', 'POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ZERO-SUM THINKING\\n47\\nVoters are uncertain about their payoffs from each policy. A payoff for voter i is a tuple\\nvi = (v\\np∗\\ni \\x03v\\np∗\\ni ) ∈V := Vp∗× Vp∗, where Vp is a ﬁnite set of potential payoffs from policy\\np. Before casting her vote, voter i receives a private signal si drawn from a ﬁnite set of\\nsignals S := {s0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03sK}. A state of the world ω comprises a payoff proﬁle v ∈Vn and a\\nsignal proﬁle s ∈Sn. Uncertainty is described by a probability distribution P on the state\\nspace \\x07 := Vn × Sn. The random variable V p denotes the payoff proﬁle from choosing\\npolicy p and S denotes the signal proﬁle.14 The population of voters and the probability\\nspace together deﬁne the collective choice problem.\\nOur baseline framework makes three assumptions. For the ﬁrst assumption, we say that\\nstate (v′\\x03s′) permutes state (v\\x03s) if there is a one-to-one mapping ψ : N →N such that\\n(v′\\ni\\x03s′\\ni) = (vψ(i)\\x03sψ(i)) for all i ∈N .\\nASSUMPTION 1: Voters are exchangeable: if ω′ permutes ω, then P(ω′) = P(ω).\\nExchangeability focuses attention on the conﬂict generated by asymmetric information\\nrather than heterogeneous ex ante preferences; we relax this assumption in Section 5.3.\\nGiven Assumption 1, all voters agree on the (ex ante) optimal policy. Without loss of\\ngenerality, we assume that p∗is the (ex ante) optimal policy and p∗is the (ex ante) inferior\\npolicy.15 We deﬁne the random variable V d := V p∗−V p∗to denote the proﬁle of payoff\\ndifferences between these two policies. For a non-null event E ⊆\\x07, we write voter i’s\\nconditional payoff difference as\\nV d\\ni (E) :=\\n\\x02\\nω∈\\x07\\n\\x03\\nV\\np∗\\ni\\n(ω) −V\\np∗\\ni\\n(ω)\\n\\x04\\nP(ω|E)\\x05\\nIf E is null, we deﬁne V d\\ni (E) = 0 to simplify exposition.\\nOur second assumption distinguishes signal s0, which is uninformative, from the remain-\\ning signals M :={s1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03sK}, which are informative.\\nASSUMPTION 2: Signal s0 is uninformative and every other signal is sufﬁcient to deduce\\nthe ex post ordinal preference: for all (v\\x03s) ∈\\x07,\\n(a) if si = s0, then P(v\\x03s) = P(v\\x03s−i)P(si); and\\n(b) if si ̸= s0, then V d\\ni (s) > 0 if and only if V d\\ni (si) > 0.\\nAssumption 2(a) asserts that signal s0 realizes independently of the payoff pro-\\nﬁle and the other signals, and hence conveys no information about these variables.\\nAssumption 2(b) speaks to the informativeness of the remaining signals: for a voter who\\nobtains an informative signal, learning the signals of others conveys no additional infor-\\nmation about her ordinal preference over policies. Hence, relative to the entire signal\\nproﬁle s, the private signal si is sufﬁcient to deduce voter i’s preferred policy. A special\\ncase is where the informed signal reveals directly one’s cardinal payoffs from each pol-\\nicy, as in our introductory example. Assumption 2(b) goes beyond this special case by\\nencompassing settings in which informed voters do not know all that much about their\\n14In general, capital letters denote random variables and lowercase letters denote realizations. For random\\nvariable X, {x} := {ω : X(ω) = x} is the event where x is realized, omitting the brackets when clear from the\\ncontext.\\n15These policies could correspond to actual policy choices, as in a referendum, or to candidates standing in\\nan election. For instance, policy p∗may represent an incumbent politician and policy p∗a challenger with little\\npolitical experience.\\n', '48\\nS. N. ALI, M. MIHM, AND L. SIGA\\ncardinal payoffs but are just well-informed relative to the electorate about their ordinal\\npreferences. We exploit this generality in Section 4.\\nAmong the informative signals, we say that signal sk conveys good news if V d\\ni (Si = sk) >\\n0 and bad news if V d\\ni (Si = sk) < 0. Being ordinal, these notions convey whether an in-\\nformed voter favors the ex ante optimal policy. For a signal proﬁle s ∈Sn, M(s) is the\\nnumber of voters who receive informative signals, G(s) is the number with good news,\\nand B(s) is the number with bad news.\\nOur ﬁnal assumption simpliﬁes exposition without playing a substantive role.\\nASSUMPTION 3: Voters have strict preferences and both bad news and good news are pos-\\nsible:\\n(a) For every voter i ∈N and non-null event E ⊆\\x07, V d\\ni (E) ̸= 0.\\n(b) P(B ≥1) > 0 and P(G ≥τ) > 0.\\nAssumption 3(a) obviates the need to describe how voters behave when indifferent and,\\nwith ﬁnitely many states, strict preferences are generic in the space of possible payoff\\nproﬁles. Assumption 3(b) rules out some trivial cases: when it is impossible to receive bad\\nsignals, voting for the inferior policy is a weakly dominated strategy; if P(G ≥τ) = 0, there\\nis always an uninteresting equilibrium where all uninformed voters select the inferior\\npolicy only because their votes are then never decisive.\\nThis completes the description of the baseline collective choice problem. We contrast\\nbehavior in this collective choice problem with private information to that in a public\\ninformation benchmark, where every voter observes the entire signal proﬁle s.\\nSolution Concept.\\nA strategy for a voter is a signal-contingent probability of voting\\nfor p∗. We study Bayes Nash equilibria in weakly undominated strategies, which implies\\nthat those with good news vote for p∗and those with bad news vote for p∗. Henceforth,\\nwe refer to these as equilibria. The following summarizes equilibrium existence in the\\nbaseline collective choice problem and the public information benchmark.\\nPROPOSITION 1: An equilibrium exists under both private and public information; in the\\nlatter case, the equilibrium is unique.\\n2.2. Scarce Information\\nWe primarily model settings in which information is “scarce”: namely, all else equal, the\\nprobability that a voter obtains the uninformative signal, s0, is relatively high. We describe\\nbelow what scarce information entails and then brieﬂy discuss our motivation.\\nTo understand how we model scarce information, suppose that signals are drawn ac-\\ncording to the following two-stage process: ﬁrst, a probability distribution chooses a state\\nin which every voter obtains an informative signal; and second, for each voter i, her sig-\\nnal is “deleted” with some independent probability, which results in her obtaining the\\nuninformative signal. For the ﬁrst stage, let PI(·) := P(·|S ∈Mn) denote the probability\\ndistribution over states conditional on all voters receiving informative signals. For the sec-\\nond stage, let λ := P(Si ∈M) denote the probability that a voter’s signal is not deleted.\\nLemma 1 in the Appendix shows that the model of Section 2 embodies this two-stage\\nprocess: under Assumptions 1 and 2(a), the probability distribution P decomposes into a\\npair (PI\\x03λ). This decomposition permits us to vary λ while all other variables, governed\\nby PI, are held ﬁxed. Information is then scarce if λ is small. We deﬁne what it means for\\na policy to win under these circumstances.\\n', 'POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ZERO-SUM THINKING\\n49\\nDEFINITION 1: Policy p wins in an equilibrium with scarce information if, for every ε in\\n(0\\x031), there exists λε in (0\\x031) such that, for all λ in (0\\x03λε), policy p wins with probability\\nat least 1 −ε in an equilibrium of the collective choice problem (N \\x03\\x07\\x03PI\\x03λ).\\nDeﬁnition 1 ﬁxes an informed collective choice problem PI and studies equilibrium\\noutcomes of the “diluted” collective choice problem (PI\\x03λ), in which a voter obtains an\\nuninformative signal with high probability, (1 −λ), and obtains a signal according to PI\\nwith a low probability, λ.\\nWe focus on electoral outcomes with scarce private information, which we compare with\\nthe benchmark of scarce public information described below.\\nPROPOSITION 2: In the public information benchmark, policy p∗wins in the unique equi-\\nlibrium with scarce information.\\nThe logic of Proposition 2 is that under scarce information, all voters are likely un-\\ninformed, and in this benchmark, that event is publicly observed. Therefore, each voter\\ncasts her vote for p∗, thereby securing its victory. Proposition 2 offers the sense in which\\nwe view the policy choice to be positive-sum: were all information public, all voters would\\nlikely have fully aligned interests. Against that backdrop, our main analysis evaluates how\\nuninformed voters behave once they do not know what others have learned.\\nApart from these conceptual reasons, we also view scarce information to be relevant\\nfrom an applied perspective. Many policy choices are inherently vague or complex, which\\nmakes it difﬁcult for most voters to anticipate policy consequences. Moreover, given the\\nrecent proliferation of noisy news and media sources, each voter may be exposed to only\\na few information sources and not know what other voters learn.16 Our analysis speaks to\\nhow zero-sum thinking can prevail in such environments, where a majority of voters are\\nlargely uninformed but suspicious that others might have an informational advantage.\\n3. THE FRAGILITY OF COLLECTIVE CHOICE\\n3.1. Adverse Correlation\\nAt the core of zero-sum thinking is the question: is good news for others also good news\\nfor me? The answer depends on how a voter’s payoff is correlated with others’ signals.\\nConsider a voter, Ann, who receives the uninformative signal. Based on only her own\\ninformation, the ex ante optimal remains optimal. Now suppose that she conditions on κ\\nvoters obtaining good news and no voter obtaining bad news. Her conditional expected\\npayoff difference is then\\nV G(κ) := V d\\ni\\n\\x03\\nG = κ\\x03B = 0\\x03Si = s0\\x04\\n\\x03\\nthat is, the expected payoff difference between the optimal and inferior policies condi-\\ntioning on Ann receiving the uninformative signal, κ others receiving good news, and no\\none receiving bad news.17\\nWe elaborate on the interpretation of this term. First, this posterior expected payoff\\nconsiders an event in which no voter obtains bad news; our analysis in Section 3.2 con-\\nﬁrms that such events play an important role in equilibrium behavior. Second, in principle,\\n16While Assumption 1(a) frames signal s0 as completely uninformative, our analysis is compatible with set-\\ntings in which all signals are at least slightly informative.\\n17We observe that V G depends only on PI and does not vary with λ.\\n', '50\\nS. N. ALI, M. MIHM, AND L. SIGA\\nit is unclear if Ann favors policy p∗more or less once she conditions on κ other voters\\nobtaining good news. On one hand, the likelihood of drawing κ good signals from κ ran-\\ndom draws is higher if policy p∗is likely to beneﬁt many voters. On the other hand, for\\nany given number of beneﬁciaries, Anne’s chances of beneﬁting from p∗herself is lower\\nonce κ “slots” are already taken by others. These effects push in opposing directions, one\\nbearing on aggregate considerations and the other on distributional considerations.\\nThe sign of V G(κ) varies with κ, depending on which effect dominates. For example,\\nif no voter obtains good news (κ = 0), the posterior expected payoff difference coincides\\nwith the prior expected payoff difference, which is strictly positive. Once some voters\\nobtain good news, the sign depends on the relative importance of the aggregate and dis-\\ntributional considerations. Our introductory example features only distributional uncer-\\ntainty and V G(κ) < 0 for every κ > 0; knowing that anyone else obtained good news in-\\nduces Ann to favor the inferior policy. By contrast, when voter preferences are perfectly\\naligned—as in a common-value problem—then there is only aggregate uncertainty in that\\nall voters gain or all lose from policy p∗. In that case, V G(κ) > 0 for every κ > 0.\\nOur correlation condition assesses if V G is negative for a relevant domain.\\nDEFINITION 2: The collective choice problem is adversely correlated if there is some κ in\\n{1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}such that V G(κ) < 0. Otherwise, the collective choice problem is advantageously\\ncorrelated.18\\nRecall that τ := (n −1)/2 is the number of votes for policy p∗that makes a voter piv-\\notal. The criterion above evaluates if there is any coalition of weakly smaller size whose\\ngood news, on net, makes an uninformed voter favor the inferior policy p∗. This criterion\\njointly evaluates the payoff and information structure: as we show in Section 4, ﬁxing a\\ndistribution of payoffs, some information structures render the collective choice problem\\nadversely correlated whereas others make it advantageously correlated. Likewise, ﬁxing\\nan information structure, payoffs can determine whether the collective choice problem is\\nadversely or advantageously correlated.\\n3.2. Main Result\\nWe show that the fragility of collective choice hinges on its correlation.\\nTHEOREM 1: The inferior policy p∗wins in a strict equilibrium with scarce information if\\nthe collective choice problem is adversely correlated. Otherwise, the optimal policy p∗wins in\\nevery equilibrium with scarce information.\\nRecall that were each voter known to be uninformed, or if all information were pub-\\nlic and scarce, every equilibrium would select policy p∗: without private information, the\\nelectorate faces a positive-sum policy choice in which the optimal policy receives unani-\\nmous support. Theorem 1 shows, by contrast, that the slightest prospect of private infor-\\nmation could result in a different equilibrium outcome. Voting behavior is fragile to pri-\\nvate information whenever the collective choice problem is adversely correlated: formally,\\nthe outcome correspondence of weakly undominated equilibria violates upper hemicon-\\ntinuity as λ →0. Conversely, advantageous correlation assures robustness. Not only does\\n18By Assumption 3(a), advantageous correlation equates to V G(κ) > 0 for every κ in {1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}.\\n', 'POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ZERO-SUM THINKING\\n51\\nthe optimal policy p∗win with non-trivial odds, it does so with near certainty in any equi-\\nlibrium, pure or mixed, asymmetric or symmetric.19\\nTo see how adverse correlation results in policy p∗winning the election, we start with\\nthe simplest case, namely V G(τ) < 0. Then, a strict equilibrium akin to that of our intro-\\nductory example implements the inferior policy: all uninformed voters vote for policy p∗.\\nAn uninformed Ann infers, conditional on being pivotal, that τ voters have voted for pol-\\nicy p∗. By construction, each of these voters must have heard good news. As information is\\nscarce, Ann believes all those who voted for p∗are likely uninformed, that is, the number\\nof voters who received bad news is likely 0. Her expected payoff difference conditional on\\nbeing pivotal then approximates V G(τ) < 0, which implies that she strictly prefers to vote\\nfor policy p∗. Because most voters are uninformed, it wins with high probability.\\nOther cases require more elaborate constructions. Let V G(τ) > 0 and κ∗be the highest\\nvalue of κ in {1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ} such that V G(κ) < 0. We construct a (strict) pure-strategy equi-\\nlibrium that is asymmetric. In this equilibrium, we label some voters as “suspicious” and\\nall others as “sanguine.” A suspicious (resp., sanguine) voter casts her vote for policy p∗\\n(resp., p∗) when she is uninformed. We specify that (τ −κ∗) voters are sanguine and all\\nothers are suspicious. Our argument establishing that this is an equilibrium hews to the\\nfollowing logic:\\n• A suspicious uninformed voter, conditional on being pivotal, places high odds on the\\nevent where (i) of the τ votes for policy p∗, (τ −κ∗) are cast by uninformed sanguine\\nvoters and the remaining κ∗votes are cast by suspicious voters who obtained good\\nnews; (ii) all the (n −τ −1) votes for policy p∗are cast by uninformed suspicious\\nvoters. Hence, her conditional expected payoff difference is close to V G(κ∗) < 0.\\nThus, she strictly prefers to vote for policy p∗.\\n• A sanguine uninformed voter makes a different calculation that stems from her being\\nsanguine: conditional on being pivotal, she puts high odds that of the τ votes for\\npolicy p∗, (τ −κ∗−1) are cast by uninformed sanguine voters and (κ∗+ 1) votes are\\ncast by suspicious voters who obtained good news. Hence, her conditional expected\\npayoff difference is close to V G(κ∗+ 1), which is strictly positive as κ∗is the highest\\nvalue of κ such that V G(κ) < 0. Thus, she strictly prefers to vote for policy p∗.\\nHaving argued that the strategy proﬁle is an equilibrium, we note that as λ →0, the\\nelection is likely decided by the uninformed voters. Given that sanguine voters are in a\\nminority, the inferior policy p∗wins with near certainty.\\nTheorem 1 also asserts that under advantageous correlation, the optimal policy pre-\\nvails in every equilibrium with near certainty. Hence, adverse correlation is also necessary\\nfor electoral failures. This direction is considerably more challenging to prove given the\\nlarge number of candidate equilibria, including those that are asymmetric and in mixed\\nstrategies. The key idea is that as private information becomes scarce, for any weakly\\nundominated strategy proﬁle, the relevant posterior payoff of an uninformed voter ap-\\nproximates a weighted sum of V G(κ) evaluated at different values of κ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}. The\\nspeciﬁc weights depend on the strategy proﬁle but, regardless of the weights, advanta-\\ngeous correlation implies that the sum is strictly positive because V G(κ) > 0 for every κ.\\n19An equivalent way to frame our results is through the lens of public and private information. Suppose that\\nall voters obtain noisy public information that indicates that policy p∗is superior. If it were commonly known\\nthat no voter obtains any additional private information, the electorate would use this public information to\\nselect policy p∗in every weakly undominated equilibrium. However, if some voters obtain additional private\\ninformation with even the slightest chance, under adverse correlation, there is an equilibrium in which the\\nelectorate fails to use public information to select the better policy. Thus, a better informed electorate might\\nmake worse choices when some of that better information is received privately by voters.\\n', '52\\nS. N. ALI, M. MIHM, AND L. SIGA\\nHence, the decisions of others in any equilibrium never generate enough bad news to\\nsway uninformed voters to vote for policy p∗with non-trivial probability.\\nIn light of our main result, the reader may wonder if adverse correlation nevertheless\\naccommodates a “good” equilibrium that selects the optimal policy? Yes.\\nTHEOREM 2: Regardless of correlation, policy p∗wins in at least some equilibrium with\\nscarce information.\\nThe logic of Theorem 2 is that although the information structure is a primitive of the\\ncollective choice problem, how an uninformed voter interprets others’ votes is determined\\nin equilibrium. Our construction in Theorem 1 sways an uninformed Ann toward policy\\np∗by having most votes in favor of policy p∗to be cast by those who have good news\\nso that, under adverse correlation, policy p∗is selected adversely to her interests. By the\\nsame logic, a strategy proﬁle in which most votes in favor of policy p∗are cast by those\\nwho have bad news could make policy p∗selected adversely to Ann’s interests, which\\nwould push Ann to vote for policy p∗. Our proof of Theorem 2 shows that the ex ante\\ninferiority of policy p∗implies that it is always feasible to construct such an equilibrium.\\nAs uninformed voters overwhelmingly vote for policy p∗in that equilibrium, it wins when\\ninformation is scarce.\\nTheorem 2 suggests that fragility is not a concern if voters can coordinate on equilibria\\nthat maximize ex ante welfare. We take the perspective that presuming voter coordina-\\ntion is not modest, particularly in large electorates or in the absence of an ex ante stage at\\nwhich all voters are known to be symmetrically informed. Theorem 1 implies that, under\\nadverse correlation, voter coordination is necessary to avoid an inferior outcome that is\\nrationalized by neither voters’ information nor their preferences; the prospect of asym-\\nmetric information, however slight, can result in this perverse outcome. By contrast, ad-\\nvantageous correlation obviates voter coordination as the optimal policy is assured across\\nall equilibria.\\nOur analysis applies beyond our baseline setting. We assume simple-majority rule but\\nour analysis invokes it only for simplicity. Suppose that policy p∗passes if it obtains at\\nleast τ + 1 votes where τ is now any number in {1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n −1}. We would continue to de-\\nﬁne adverse and advantageous correlation as per Deﬁnition 2, and Theorem 1 still holds.\\nTherefore, increasing the number of votes required for policy p∗to pass only expands the\\nset of parameters for which adverse correlation holds.\\nSection 5 describes elaborations that require further analysis. A similar characteriza-\\ntion obtains for symmetric equilibria under a slightly different correlation condition; that\\nanalysis also accommodates population uncertainty. We also relax the condition that vot-\\ners are ex ante symmetric, allowing for some voters to be “elites” who are more likely\\nto beneﬁt from the optimal policy. We show that this ex ante conﬂict only ampliﬁes the\\nforces described here. Before describing these extensions, we focus on a tractable class of\\nthe baseline model to identify various sources of adverse correlation.\\n4. SOURCES OF ADVERSE CORRELATION\\nIn this section, we study features of a collective choice problem that lead to adverse\\ncorrelation. For this comparison, we focus on a class of collective choice problem with\\nbinary payoffs: V d\\ni ∈{vw\\x03−vℓ} for some vw and vℓstrictly positive, so that each voter’s ex\\npost payoff from p∗is either vw higher or vℓlower than that from p∗.20 The event Wi :=\\n20For instance, \\x07 ={vw\\x03−vℓ}n ×{0}n × Sn for some vw > 0 and vℓ> 0.\\n', 'POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ZERO-SUM THINKING\\n53\\n{ω : V d\\ni (ω) > 0} comprises all states where voter i gains from policy p∗, and is referred to\\nas a winner. The number of winners in state ω is W (ω) :=|{i ∈N : ω ∈Wi}|. As policy p∗\\nis ex ante optimal, we are assuming throughout that P(Wi)vw −(1 −P(Wi))vℓ> 0.\\nIn this class of collective choice problems, we study how varying the payoffs, the proba-\\nbility distribution on the number of winners, and the nature of the information conveyed\\nby signals affects the correlation structure.\\n4.1. Polarization Ratios and the Crowding-Out Effect\\nWe ﬁrst ﬁx a simple information structure to focus on payoffs: suppose that informative\\nsignals convey perfect news in that an informed voter learns if she is a winner or loser, that\\nis, P(Wi|Si = sk) ∈{0\\x031} for each informative signal sk. The collective choice problem can\\nthen be represented through the tuple (PW \\x03v) where PW is the (marginal) distribution\\non the number of winners, PW : {0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n} →[0\\x031], and v := (vw\\x03vℓ) speciﬁes the ex post\\npayoff differences. We write V G(κ;PW \\x03v) as the value of V G(κ) for this collective choice\\nproblem, and order collective choice problems by their propensity for adverse correlation.\\nDEFINITION 3: A collective choice problem (PW \\x03v) is more adversely correlated than\\nthe collective choice problem (P′\\nW \\x03v′) if, for every κ ∈{1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ},\\nV G\\x03\\nκ|P′\\nW \\x03v′\\x04\\n< 0\\n=⇒\\nV G(κ|PW \\x03v) < 0\\x05\\nWe denote this binary relation by ≽AC.21\\nWe identify two sources of adverse correlation. The ﬁrst views payoffs through their\\npolarization ratio: given binary payoffs (vw\\x03vℓ), the polarization ratio vℓ/vw measures the\\nproportional costs incurred by losers relative to the gains that accrue to winners. The sec-\\nond views the crowding-out effect through likelihood ratios: the probability distribution\\nP′\\nW likelihood-ratio dominates PW , denoted P′\\nW ≽LR PW , if P′\\nW (w′)PW (w) ≥P′\\nW (w)PW (w′)\\nwhenever w′ > w.\\nPROPOSITION 3: The following comparative statics results hold:\\n(a) A higher polarization ratio induces more adverse correlation: (PW \\x03v) ≽AC (PW \\x03v′) if\\nvℓ/vw ≥v′\\nℓ/v′\\nw.\\n(b) Likelihood-ratio dominance induces less adverse correlation: (P′\\nW \\x03v) ≽AC (PW \\x03v) if\\nPW ≽LR P′\\nW .\\nA higher polarization ratio increases adverse correlation because, relative to the infe-\\nrior policy p∗, a higher polarization ratio worsens the gamble from the optimal policy\\np∗both ex ante and ex interim. By contrast, a likelihood-ratio dominant increase in the\\nmarginal distribution over the number of winners has the opposite effect because it re-\\nduces crowding-out from learning that others received good news. In combination with\\nTheorem 1, Proposition 3 implies that increasing the polarization ratio or reducing the\\nlikelihood ratio makes collective choice more fragile to asymmetric information.\\nAn implication of Proposition 3 is that redistributive programs may alleviate zero-sum\\nthinking. Coupling policy p∗with transfers from winners to losers would lower the polar-\\nization ratio and mitigate the concern of crowding-out. Concretely, if trade expansion is\\n21We note that ≽AC is a preorder in that it is reﬂexive and transitive but not complete.\\n', '54\\nS. N. ALI, M. MIHM, AND L. SIGA\\naccompanied by retraining programs for displaced workers, then a referendum on a trade\\nagreement may be more likely to pass as the collective choice problem would then be\\nless adversely correlated. Redistribution can transform an adversely correlated collective\\nchoice problem into one that is advantageously correlated.\\nA Large Election Analysis.\\nWe build on this analysis of crowding-out behavior to show\\nthat zero-sum thinking may prevail even when information is abundant. For this analysis,\\nwe hold the primitives ﬁxed and study behavior as the population size n →∞, assuming\\nthroughout that n is odd. Our focus here is on distributional uncertainty and the crowding-\\nout effect so, as in the introductory example, we ﬁx the proportion of winners: there is\\nsome q in [1/2\\x031) such that in the election with n voters, there are ⌈qn⌉winners. Policy p∗\\nbeing ex ante optimal for every n is then equivalent to the polarization ratio, vℓ/vw, being\\nstrictly less than q/(1 −q).\\nWe identify a critical polarization ratio that determines if adverse or advantageous cor-\\nrelation holds in a large election: using {τn} to denote the event where n−1\\n2\\nvoters receive\\ngood news and no voter receives bad news, the critical polarization ratio is\\nρ := lim\\nn→∞\\nPn\\n\\x03\\nWi|{τn}\\n\\x04\\n1 −Pn\\n\\x03\\nWi|{τn}\\n\\x04 =\\nq −1\\n2\\n1 −q \\x05\\nOur ﬁrst result connects this critical polarization ratio to adverse correlation in large elec-\\ntions.\\nPROPOSITION 4: If vℓ/vw > ρ, then there exists N such that, for all n > N, the n-voter\\ncollective choice problem has adverse correlation; otherwise, for every n, the n-voter collective\\nchoice problem has advantageous correlation.\\nProposition 4 obtains a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for adverse correlation in all\\nsufﬁciently large elections. We use this result to characterize electoral outcomes in a large\\nelection.\\nPROPOSITION 5: If vℓ/vw > ρ, there exists λ∗> 0 such that, for all λ < λ∗, the inferior\\npolicy wins in a strict equilibrium of a large election.22 Otherwise, for every population size n\\nand λ in (0\\x031), the optimal policy wins with probability 1 in every equilibrium.\\nHence, if there is adverse correlation, the inferior policy wins with near certainty in a\\nstrict equilibrium of a large election; otherwise, the optimal policy wins with certainty in\\nevery equilibrium for every population size.\\nWe note several features of this result. First, it ﬁxes a λ > 0 and then takes n →∞.\\nThe order of limits therefore differs from that of Theorem 1. Information need not be\\nscarce and may actually be abundant. We show in the proof that λ∗≥1 −(vℓ/vw)−1ρ.\\nUsing the parameters of the introductory example, namely q = 2/3, vℓ= 3, and vw = 2, the\\ninferior policy wins in a strict equilibrium of a large election for any λ ∈(0\\x03 2/3). Hence,\\nit may even be more likely that voters are informed than uninformed, and nonetheless,\\nthe inferior policy wins. Second, as the bound 1 −(vℓ/vw)−1ρ indicates, increasing the\\n22Formally, for every ε in (0\\x031), there exists Nε such that, for all n > Nε, there is a strict equilibrium of the\\nn-voter collective choice problem in which the inferior policy wins with probability at least 1 −ε.\\n', 'POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ZERO-SUM THINKING\\n55\\npolarization ratio only expands the region in which the inferior policy wins. Third, ﬁxing\\nall other parameters, increasing the population size may expand the range of λ for which\\nthere is an equilibrium in which all uninformed voters vote for p∗. This effect is evident\\nin our introductory example: for n = 3, this equilibrium exists if λ is in (0\\x03 1/3), whereas\\nif n is sufﬁciently large, the equilibrium exists whenever λ is in (0\\x03 2/3). Finally, a large\\nelection makes it even more likely that policy p∗wins in a large election.23 Thus, in a large\\nelection with abundant information, zero-sum thinking may not only prevail but also be\\neven more pronounced.\\n4.2. Aggregate and Distributional Information\\nElectoral choices are also shaped by the kind of information voters obtain. Contrast the\\nfollowing messages by Republican Presidents about the economic consequences of trade\\nliberalization:\\n“Free trade serves the cause of economic progress. . . ”—Reagan, 1982\\n“Members of the club—the consultants, the pollsters, the politicians, the pundits, and the special interests—\\ngrow rich and powerful while the American people grow poorer and more isolated. . . ”—Trump, 2016\\nThe former emphasizes aggregate consequences without referring to who beneﬁts and\\nloses, whereas the latter focuses on those distributional consequences without speaking\\nabout aggregate gains. Politicians and media outlets can choose between focusing their\\nmessaging on aggregate or distributional consequences. Here, we identify how this choice\\naffects voting behavior.\\nTo this end, we depart from the perfect news considered in Section 4.1. Instead, we say\\nthat signals convey only aggregate news if P(V = v|S = s\\x03W = w) = P(V = v|W = w) for\\nany payoff proﬁle v, signal proﬁle s, and number of winners w such that P(W = w) > 0.\\nThat is, conditioning on the number of winners, voters learn nothing further about the\\npayoffs from their signals.\\nPROPOSITION 6: Suppose signals convey only aggregate news. Then, for every polarization\\nratio, the collective choice problem is advantageously correlated.\\nWe contrast this case with one where signals convey only distributional news: P(W =\\nw|S = s) = P(W = w) for any signal proﬁle s and number of winners w, that is, signals\\nare uninformative about the number of winners.\\nPROPOSITION 7: Suppose signals convey only distributional news. Then, holding the sig-\\nnal structure ﬁxed, there is a polarization ratio ˆρ such that the collective choice problem is\\nadversely correlated whenever vℓ/vw ≥ˆρ.24\\nThe contrast between Propositions 6 and 7 reveals how the information structure may\\npreclude or induce adverse correlation by focusing on aggregate or distributional news.\\nThis ﬁnding dovetails with Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) and Perego and Yuksel (2022)\\nwho showed that media providers may proﬁt from delivering information that polarizes\\nvoters. In conjunction with their analysis, Proposition 7 suggests that this proﬁt-seeking\\nbehavior may have detrimental effects on elections.25\\n23To illustrate, consider the introductory example and suppose that λ = 1/4. Then, if n = 3, the probability\\nthat p∗wins in our constructed equilibrium is 27/32, whereas this probability converges to 1 as n →∞.\\n24In the proof, we show that policy p∗remains optimal at the critical ˆρ.\\n25Focusing on a different force, Yuksel (2022) showed that segregation in news consumption has a further\\npolarizing effect on the electoral platforms chosen by parties.\\n', '56\\nS. N. ALI, M. MIHM, AND L. SIGA\\n5. EXTENSIONS\\n5.1. A Characterization for Symmetric Equilibria\\nThe analysis of Theorem 1 considers all equilibria, including those that are asymmet-\\nric.26 Restricting to symmetric equilibria, a stronger form of adverse correlation is nec-\\nessary for the inferior policy to win with scarce information, while a weaker form of ad-\\nvantageous correlation is sufﬁcient to guarantee that the optimal policy wins across all\\nsymmetric equilibria.\\nIn a symmetric (weakly undominated) equilibrium, informed voters choose their pre-\\nferred policy and all uninformed voters choose p∗with the same probability α ∈[0\\x031].\\nWhen α ∈(0\\x031), a voter can be pivotal when κ others receive good news for any\\nκ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}, because it is always possible for exactly τ −κ uninformed voters to choose\\np∗along with the κ voters who received good news. However, these events are not equally\\nlikely, depending both on the primitive probability of events and the behavior of unin-\\nformed voters. The relevant correlation measure for symmetric equilibria therefore in-\\nvolves a weighted sum of the conditional payoffs V G(·) evaluated at different values of\\nκ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}:\\nK(θ) :=\\nτ\\n\\x02\\nκ=0\\nθκ\\n\\x05\\nτ\\nκ\\n\\x06\\nP(G = κ|B = 0)V G(κ)\\x05\\nThis sum again focuses on the perspective of an uninformed voter, whose expected payoff\\ndifference conditional on κ others receiving good news and no one receiving bad news\\nis V G(κ). In each summand, P(G = κ|B = 0) is the primitive probability that κ voters\\nreceive good news, conditional on no one receiving bad news. The binomial coefﬁcient\\nis an adjustment factor to account for the number of ways that the uninformed voter\\ncan be pivotal when no one receives bad news.27 As we elaborate below, the variable\\nθ encodes the relative likelihood that, in a symmetric mixed strategy proﬁle, a vote for\\npolicy p∗is cast by an informed rather than an uninformed voter, when κ voters received\\ngood news and no one received bad news. In particular, θκ offers additional ﬂexibility\\nin weighting the summands: taking θ →0 concentrates weight on the term that involves\\nV G(0), whereas θ →∞focuses the sum on the term that involves V G(τ).\\nThe relevant correlation measure here is the inﬁmum, K∗:= infθ∈R++ K(θ).\\nDEFINITION 4: The collective choice problem is strongly adversely correlated if K∗< 0\\nand weakly advantageously correlated if K∗> 0.\\nOn one hand, V G(κ) > 0 for all κ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ} is sufﬁcient but not necessary for K∗> 0,\\nand so advantageous correlation implies weak advantageous correlation but not vice\\nversa. On the other hand, V G(κ) < 0 for some κ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ} is necessary but not sufﬁ-\\ncient for K∗< 0, and so strong adverse correlation implies adverse correlation but not\\nvice versa.28\\n26We note that the equilibria described in Proposition 1, Proposition 2, and Theorem 2 are symmetric.\\n27Note that\\n\\x03 τ\\nκ\\n\\x04\\n=\\n\\x03 n\\nτ\\n\\x04−1\\x03 n\\nκ\\n\\x04\\x03 n−κ\\nτ−κ\\n\\x04\\n, where\\n\\x03 n\\nκ\\n\\x04\\nis the number of ways of selecting the κ voters that receive\\ngood news,\\n\\x03 n−κ\\nτ−κ\\n\\x04\\nis the number of ways of selecting τ −κ uninformed voters to vote for the optimal policy\\nalong with voters who received good news, and their product is normalized by the total number of ways of\\nselecting τ votes for the optimal policy\\n\\x03 n\\nτ\\n\\x04\\n.\\n28However, V G(τ) < 0 does imply K∗< 0 because, as θ →∞, the τth summand in K(θ) dominates.\\n', 'POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ZERO-SUM THINKING\\n57\\nEvery collective choice problem is either strongly adversely or weakly advantageously\\ncorrelated except in the knife-edge case where K∗= 0, which is possible only on a\\nmeasure-0 set of parameters. Parallel to Theorem 1, the following theorem therefore\\nessentially characterizes when a collective choice problem is fragile to asymmetric infor-\\nmation with a restriction to symmetric equilibria.\\nTHEOREM 3: If the collective choice problem is strongly adversely correlated, the inferior\\npolicy p∗wins in a symmetric equilibrium with scarce information. By contrast, if the collec-\\ntive choice problem is weakly advantageously correlated, then the optimal policy p∗wins in\\nevery symmetric equilibrium with scarce information.\\nHence, fragility also emerges with symmetric equilibria. However, establishing this\\nfragility requires a different argument. Suppose that the collective choice problem is\\nstrongly adversely correlated; moreover, assume that V G(τ) > 0.29 We show that a se-\\nquence of symmetric mixed strategy equilibria selects policy p∗with probability approach-\\ning 1 as λ →0. The idea is that K∗< 0 implies the existence of ˜θ such that K( ˜θ) = 0. For\\neach λ ∈(0\\x031), we then choose α such that ˜θ =\\nλ\\n(1−λ)α; in other words, ˜θ is the relative\\nlikelihood that a vote for p∗is cast by an informed voter. Choosing α at this rate guar-\\nantees that an uninformed voter is indifferent between policies p∗and p∗conditional on\\nbeing pivotal, which rationalizes her mixing. Moreover, as λ →0, the probability that an\\nuninformed voter votes for p∗converges to 0. As most voters are uninformed, policy p∗\\nthen wins with near certainty.\\nThe converse also requires a different argument because weak advantageous correla-\\ntion does not imply advantageous correlation. However, weak advantageous correlation\\nis sufﬁcient to ensure that, regardless of how one pools votes for p∗from uninformed vot-\\ners and those who hear good news, uninformed voters are never swayed to vote for policy\\np∗with substantial probability in any symmetric equilibrium.\\n5.2. Population Uncertainty\\nThe characterization for symmetric equilibria can also accommodate population uncer-\\ntainty. Suppose that, as in Myerson (1998), the population size is random. For simplicity,\\nwe assume that the population size is always odd and a policy p ∈{p∗\\x03p∗} is then chosen\\nby simple majority rule: for a realized population of n voters, policy p wins if it receives\\nat least τ(n) + 1 votes, where τ(n) := n−1\\n2 . We make the following assumption about the\\nrandom population size.\\nASSUMPTION 4: The population size N is drawn from a probability measure Q with a ﬁnite\\nexpectation and support Q, which is a subset of the odd positive integers strictly greater than 1.\\nLet \\x07n = Vn × Sn be the state space for a realized population size n. Uncertainty is\\ndescribed by the random population size (Q\\x03Q) and a stochastic process {(\\x07n\\x03Pn) : n ∈\\nQ}, where Pn is a probability distribution over payoff and signals proﬁles, ω ∈\\x07n, for the\\nvoters in an election for population size n. We adapt our main assumptions in Section 2 to\\napply conditional on each population size n (see the Supplemental Appendix for a formal\\ndescription). In addition, we assume that for every population size n, the ex ante optimal\\npolicy p∗is also optimal conditioning on only the population size n.\\n29If V G(τ) < 0, the equilibrium constructed in the proof of Theorem 1 is already symmetric.\\n', '58\\nS. N. ALI, M. MIHM, AND L. SIGA\\nWe generalize the correlation measure considered in Section 5.1, considering infer-\\nences that a voter draws were she to think that the population size is n0, which is the\\nsmallest population size in Q. Adapting our previous notation, let V G(κ\\x03n0) := V d\\ni (Si =\\ns0\\x03G = κ\\x03B = 0\\x03N = n0) denote the expected payoff difference for a voter who receives\\nthe uninformative signal, conditioning on κ voters obtaining good news, no voter obtain-\\ning bad news, and there being n0 voters (where n0 ≥κ). This term feeds into the relevant\\ncorrelation measure:\\nK∗(n0) := inf\\nθ∈R++\\nτ(n0)\\n\\x02\\nκ=0\\nθκ\\n\\x05\\nτ(n0)\\nκ\\n\\x06\\nP(G = κ|B = 0)V G(κ\\x03n0)\\x05\\nTHEOREM 4: If K∗(n0) < 0, the inferior policy p∗wins in a symmetric equilibrium with\\nscarce information. By contrast, if K∗(n0) > 0, the optimal policy p∗wins in every symmetric\\nequilibrium with scarce information.\\nThe key idea is that an uninformed voter believes she is most likely to be pivotal in a\\nsmall election, and increasingly so as information becomes scarce. Hence, although she\\nmay expect that the population is large, her beliefs about adverse correlation at popula-\\ntion size n0 drive behavior.\\n5.3. The Role of Elites\\nOur baseline model isolates the role of asymmetric information by assuming away all\\nother differences between voters. However, many policy debates that feature zero-sum\\nthinking also involve voters who are ex ante heterogeneous. In this section, we show that\\nheterogeneity makes the election more ripe for zero-sum thinking.\\nWe continue to assume that for each voter, p∗is ex ante optimal. We weaken Assump-\\ntion 1 to a “within-group exchangeability” notion: we decompose voters into “elites” and\\n“non-elites” and assume that voters are exchangeable within each group but not necessar-\\nily across groups. The collective choice problem therefore consists of the set of elite voters\\nE, non-elite voters NE, and a probability space (\\x07\\x03P) = (Vn × Sn\\x03P) such that Assump-\\ntions 2 and 3 are satisﬁed, and for any permutations, ψE : E →E and ψN : NE →NE,\\nand state ω, P(ωE\\x03ωN E) = P(ωψE(E)\\x03ωψN (N E)).\\nGiven a non-empty set of voters H, let GH denote the random variable describing the\\nnumber of voters in H who received good news.\\nDEFINITION 5: The collective choice problem is elite-adversely correlated if there exists\\na binary partition of the electorate, {E\\x03NE} such that the following hold:\\n(a) Elites are a minority: |E|< τ.\\n(b) Elites do not fear the support of others:\\nV d\\ni\\n\\x03\\nSi = s0\\x03B = 0\\x03G = GN E = τ −|E| + 1\\n\\x04\\n> 0\\nfor every i ∈E\\x05\\n(c) Non-elites fear the support of others:\\nV d\\ni\\n\\x03\\nSi = s0\\x03B = 0\\x03G = GN E = τ −|E|\\n\\x04\\n< 0\\nfor every i ∈NE\\x05\\nDeﬁnition 5(a) asserts that the elites are a minority of the electorate. Part (b) states\\nthat these voters continue to support the optimal policy even after conditioning on the\\n', 'POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ZERO-SUM THINKING\\n59\\nsupport of others. In other words, they are not concerned about adverse selection. Part\\n(c) states that non-elites, by contrast, are concerned by adverse selection: knowing that all\\nelites vote for the optimal policy, each views her odds of gaining from p∗to be low when\\nsufﬁciently many non-elite voters obtain good news. Parts (b) and (c) together imply that\\nelites are more likely to beneﬁt from policy p∗.\\nA special case of Deﬁnition 5 is where each elite voter has a higher “rank” than every\\nnon-elite voter in that an elite voter is guaranteed to gain from the optimal policy p∗\\nwhenever a non-elite voter does. An elite voter then is elated to learn that any non-elite\\nvoter has good news for it assures that she, too, gains from p∗. By contrast, non-elites\\nare crowded out from being winners both by elites and other non-elites. In this vein,\\nDeﬁnition 5 views the optimal policy as a gamble that is simply more likely to beneﬁt\\nelites before its rewards trickle down to non-elite voters.\\nAs voters agree that p∗is ex ante optimal, it remains the winner with scarce public\\ninformation. But collective choice is still fragile to private information.\\nPROPOSITION 8: If payoffs are elite-adversely correlated, the inferior policy p∗wins in a\\nstrict equilibrium with scarce information.\\nThe idea is that elite voters, unconcerned by adverse selection, vote for p∗even when\\nthey are uninformed. As elites are a minority, p∗can only be in the race if it has sufﬁ-\\ncient support from non-elites. An uninformed non-elite voter then worries about being\\ncrowded out and hence has a strict incentive to vote for p∗.\\nMoreover, the presence of elite voters can exacerbate adverse selection for non-elites.\\nTo see how, we specialize to the binary payoff setup described in Section 4.1, in which\\ninformed voters obtain perfect news, and assume that Wi ⊆Wj for all i ∈NE and j ∈E, so\\nthat an elite voter is assured to gain from p∗if a non-elite voter does. The collective choice\\nproblem is then fully described by the probability that a voter receives an informative\\nsignal λ, the ex ante distribution over the number of winners PW , the payoffs v = (vW \\x03vL),\\nand the number of elite voters e :=|E|. Let ˜E(e) := {ω ∈\\x07 : Si = s0\\x03B = 0\\x03G = GN E =\\nτ −e}.\\nPROPOSITION 9: For a non-elite voter i, the conditional expected payoff V d\\ni ( ˜E(e)|PW \\x03v\\x03e)\\nis strictly decreasing in the number of elites e.\\nHence, increasing the size of the elite group expands the range of polarization ratios for\\nwhich the collective choice problem is majority-adversely correlated, leading to a greater\\nscope for political failures.\\n6. ZERO-SUM THINKING IN PRACTICE\\nHere, we view some recent political episodes through the lens of our model.\\nConsider, ﬁrst, the public debate on whether the U.S. government should bail out ﬁ-\\nnancial institutions following the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. The Bush administration\\nand other government ofﬁcials emphasized that a bailout was necessary: Ben Bernanke,\\nthe then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, argued in a Senate hearing on 24th September\\n2008 that\\n“I believe if the credit markets are not functioning, that jobs will be lost, the unemployment rate will rise,\\nmore houses will be foreclosed upon, GDP will contract, that the economy will just not be able to recover in\\na normal, healthy way, no matter what other policies are taken.”\\n', '60\\nS. N. ALI, M. MIHM, AND L. SIGA\\nNevertheless, the bill proposing the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA)\\ndid not pass in the U.S. House of Representatives in an initial vote on 29th September.\\nCongressional leaders were inﬂuenced by the large-scale protests against the perceived\\nzero-sum transfer from Main Street to Wall Street, a popular sentiment that was echoed\\nby Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama’s refrain that “taxpayers shouldn’t\\nbe spending a dime to reward CEOs on Wall Street while they’re going out the door.” The\\nEESA passed a second vote on October 3rd only after one of the biggest one-day market\\ncollapses in U.S. history sent a visible signal of the severe macroeconomic risks from a\\nfailure to stabilize the ﬁnancial system.\\nWhile it was clear that the ﬁnancial industry would proﬁt from the proposed $700 bil-\\nlion bailout, there was considerable aggregate and distributional uncertainty about the\\nbroader general equilibrium effects of the deteriorating credit market conditions. Would\\na bailout be solely distributional, transferring wealth from taxpayers to CEOs, or would\\nthere be signiﬁcant beneﬁcial aggregate effects of bailing out ﬁnancial institutions? In-\\nformation on this score was scarce given the sheer complexity of predicting the effects of\\napproving or rejecting the bill, and much of the information in the public sphere empha-\\nsized distributional considerations. In line with Propositions 7 and 8, our analysis suggests\\nthat the political debate was ripe for the kind of zero-sum thinking that initially doomed\\nthe EESA bill to fail. Our analysis also speaks to why, following the subsequent market\\ncrash, the EESA bill passed on its second vote; that crash produced clear information\\nabout the aggregate beneﬁts of stabilizing the ﬁnancial system, rendering the collective\\nchoice problem more advantageously correlated during the second vote.30\\nAnother important case is the Brexit referendum of 2016. As discussed in the Intro-\\nduction, most estimates both before and after Brexit have indicated that being part of the\\nEU beneﬁts the UK economy, both workers and consumers. However, during the refer-\\nendum, many details of the “Leave” policy were left unspeciﬁed, making its aggregate\\nand distributional ramiﬁcations uncertain. Nevertheless, most accounts of Brexit paint its\\nsupport as coming from a distrust of the London elite and the EU as well as the increased\\npressure on public services that came from waves of immigration; see, for example, Osuna\\net al. (2019). In this setting, information was scarce and the debate largely focused on dis-\\ntributional considerations, both in terms of the contrast between elites and non-elites as\\nwell as the “zero-sum game” in public services that could be allocated to “natives” versus\\n“foreigners.”\\nMore broadly, we view elements of our analysis to offer a plausible account for how\\neconomic anxiety fuels the demand for populist policies. In their survey, Guriev and Pa-\\npaioannou (2022) noted several instances and suggested that “identifying the exact mech-\\nanisms is still an open question.”31 Our analysis offers an informational mechanism: sup-\\npose that voters do not know if losers will be compensated following greater trade or\\n30Necessarily, our analysis abstracts from many factors, some of which increase the scope for zero-sum think-\\ning. We draw attention to how some actors who were privy to the details of the EESA were closely connected\\nto the ﬁnancial industry. Mian, Suﬁ, and Trebbi (2010) also documented that politicians supporting the EESA\\nappear responsive to their constituents as well as to lobbying efforts and contributions from the ﬁnancial in-\\ndustry. Allowing for those who gain from a policy to obtain better information would make a less informed\\nvoter even more distrustful than in our model.\\n31A notable example in the U.S. context is the economic and political response to the China shock, which\\nresulted in a signiﬁcant drop in manufacturing employment and wages (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2016));\\nAutor, Dorn, Hanson, and Majlesi (2020) documented how this shock has contributed to political polarization\\nand much stronger support for politicians who run on protectionist platforms. Outside the United States,\\nDal Bó, Finan, Folke, Persson, and Rickne (2023) noted how support for the populist radical-right Sweden-\\nDemocrats came from marginalized voters who were far more vulnerable to losing their jobs to immigrants.\\n', 'POLITICAL ECONOMY OF ZERO-SUM THINKING\\n61\\nimmigration liberalization, and look to the past to form these beliefs. Were there signif-\\nicant transfers in the past, then voters might see their interests as aligned; however, the\\nabsence of past transfers might lead them to worry more about the crowding-out effect,\\nin line with Proposition 3. Moreover, in line with Proposition 8, voters that are more vul-\\nnerable to trade and immigration have more reason to anticipate being crowded out and\\nmay therefore be more inclined toward protectionist and populist policies.\\n7. CONCLUSION\\nOur work describes a strategic mechanism for zero-sum thinking in elections, even if\\nthe policy choice is not zero sum. We ﬁnd that voters may choose policies that do not\\nmatch their collective preferences and information, and that equilibria may be fragile to\\nasymmetric information.\\nThe central logic resembles Akerlof’s Lemons Problem: a voter votes against policies\\nsupported by others because she is suspicious of what their support means for her. This\\nline of thinking resonates with political rhetoric, particularly in the context of populist\\nmovements that suggest that the interests of the elites are fundamentally misaligned with\\nthose of the common voter. Although we model the equilibrium logic as applying at an\\nindividual level, one could have done so at a group level, in the spirit of ethical voter\\nmodels (Coate and Conlin (2004), Feddersen and Sandroni (2006)).32 We also see this\\nlogic as potentially manifesting in other political contexts, such as legislative action and\\nlobbying, where the interested parties do not expect all to gain but have to act jointly to\\nselect a policy. Each player may then worry about being crowded out from gains when she\\nconditions on others supporting a policy.\\nWhile our analysis tackles several important questions, it leaves others unanswered.\\nWe abstract from costly turnout decisions and it may be useful to see how endogenous\\nparticipation affects collective choice. Equally, it would be interesting to see how parties\\nstrategically choose policies to exploit polarization.33 One may also envision the design\\nof information structures to capitalize on zero-sum thinking. We hope to address these\\nquestions in future work.\\nAPPENDIX\\nThe appendix has the following structure:\\n• Appendix A.1 includes preliminary results and notation, describes the decomposition\\ndetailed in Section 2.2, and contains all proofs for Section 2.\\n• Appendix A.2 contains all proofs for Section 3.\\nThe Supplemental Appendix contains all proofs for Sections 4 and 5.\\nA.1.

Proofs for Section 3\\nIn Section 3, we ﬁx (N \\x03\\x07I\\x03PI), and look at the equilibrium outcomes of the\\nfamily of collective choice problems {(N \\x03\\x07\\x03PI\\x03λ) : λ ∈(0\\x031)} as λ gets small. By\\nLemma 1, the correlation structure is a property of PI: if any collective choice problem\\nin {(N \\x03\\x07\\x03PI\\x03λ) : λ ∈(0\\x031)} is adversely/advantageously correlated, then all collective\\nchoice problems in the class have the same correlation.\\nSince PI is ﬁxed, we write the expected payoff difference \\x11i(C\\x03σ) simply as a function\\nof λ and σ. For κ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}, Assumption 3 implies that P(G = κ|M = κ\\x03Si = s0) > 0\\nand V G(κ) ̸= 0; hence, Z(κ\\x03κ) ̸= 0 and, moreover, Z(κ\\x03κ) > 0 if and only if V G(κ) > 0.\\nA.2.1. Proof of Theorem 1\\nSuppose the collective choice problem is adversely correlated: V G(κ) < 0 for some κ ∈\\n{1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}. For any t ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n}, let σt be the strategy-proﬁle in \\x10∗where σt\\ni = 1[i ≤t]\\nfor all i ∈N (i.e., the ﬁrst t voters vote for p∗when uninformed and the remaining voters\\nvote for p∗when uninformed). Let Nt ={1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03t} and N c\\nt ={t + 1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n}.\\nNow ﬁx ε ∈(0\\x031) and let λε = 1 −(1 −ε)\\n1\\nn . If t ≤τ, p∗wins in the event {S = s0}\\nand so, for all λ ∈(0\\x03λε), the probability that p∗wins is greater than (1 −ε). We can\\ntherefore complete the proof by showing that there exists ¯λ such that, for all λ < ¯λ, σt is\\nan equilibrium for some t ≤τ. We do this by considering the two cases where V G(τ) < 0\\nand V G(τ) > 0.\\nCase 1: When V G(τ) < 0, σ0 is an equilibrium for λ sufﬁciently small.\\nFor any voter i ∈N , pi(σ0|g\\x03m) = 1[g = τ] because only voters with good signals vote\\nfor p∗.

We show that asymmetric information and distributional considerations together make voters wary of policies supported by others. This force impels a majority of voters to support policies contrary to their preferences and information. Our analysis identiﬁes and in- terprets a form of “adverse correlation” that is necessary and sufﬁcient for zero-sum thinking to prevail in equilibrium.   ZERO-SUM THINKING approaches policy decisions with the mindset that gains that accrue to some parties necessarily come at the expense of others. A remarkable feature of this worldview is that it manifests even in non zero-sum choices, where one policy is widely regarded to beneﬁt voters on average. For instance, experts see the immigration of skilled labor as spurring economic growth and innovation, creating a larger tax base, and even leading to greater employment of those native-born through complementarities and ag- glomeration effects.1 Nevertheless, a common refrain against immigration stresses that every job taken by an immigrant could otherwise have gone to a native. In trade policy, economists typically emphasize that free trade is mutually beneﬁcial, allowing consumers to obtain goods and services at lower prices (e.g., Sapienza and Zingales (2013)). Yet, pro- tectionist arguments focus on how elites within a country gain at the expense of workers. This “us versus them” mindset is prominent in populist movements today. Leading up to the Brexit referendum of 2016, the majority of analysts viewed membership in the Eu- ropean Union as a “positive-sum” policy and cautioned that leaving would be detrimental to UK workers, consumers, and businesses.2 However, the Leave campaign pointed to the    1According to a poll run by Chicago Booth’s Kent Clark Center, 81% of economists surveyed disagreed with the claim that reducing H-1B visas would increase U.S. tax revenues, and 64% disagreed with the claim that it would increase employment for American workers; see https://www.kentclarkcenter.org/surveys/high-skilled- immigrant-visas/.', 'elite’s resistance to the reform as evidence that the average citizen would beneﬁt from Brexit. The leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, framed the debate as “a coalition of the politicians against the people” and declared Brexit to be “a victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people....”3 The campaign thus exploited a zero-sum perspective on EU membership to generate support for the reform. Analogously, in his 2016 presidential campaign, the then Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump promised to pull the United States out of the Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership, which he asserted was “another disaster done and pushed by special inter- ests...”. He fulﬁlled his promise once he became president and viewed his executive order as a “Great thing for the American worker...” Yet, analyses of trade suggest that the TPP was positive-sum economically and politically (Petri and Plummer (2016)).4 All of the above suggests a puzzle: why does zero-sum thinking prevail even in positive- sum settings in which voters’ interests are largely aligned? Prior work (e.g., Meegan (2010), Chinoy, Nunn, Sequeira, and Stantcheva (2024)) has largely viewed zero-sum thinking as a psychological trait. In contrast, we offer an informational microfoundation that shows how zero-sum thinking can manifest even with completely rational voters. We study policy choices in which voters do not know how many and who beneﬁt from one policy versus another. We ﬁnd that distributional uncertainty coupled with asymmet- ric information gives rise to zero-sum thinking: a voter votes against policies supported by others out of fear of what their support means for her. We show that this effect can push an electorate overall to support policies contrary to its interests. This mechanism is purely strategic, emerging independently of identity politics or partisan interests, and even with voters who are ex ante symmetric. To see how the strategic mechanism works, consider the following example. Ann, Bella, and Carol vote between policies p∗and p∗, and the policy that obtains more votes wins. Each voter’s payoff from policy p∗is 0. By contrast, policy p∗results in two winners, each of whom accrue a payoff of 2, and one loser, who obtains a payoff of −3. Ex ante, voters are symmetric: there are three equally likely states of the world, {ωA\\x03ωB\\x03ωC}, where ωi is the state in which voter i is the loser. Given these payoffs, policy p∗would win the election were voters fully informed, that is, to know the state of the world. Being ex ante optimal, that policy would also prevail if all voters were known to be uninformed, that is, the no-information benchmark.5 Our interest is in the setting in which voters may be asymmetrically informed. Suppose that each voter privately learns her payoff from policy p∗with (independent) probability λ > 0 and otherwise remains uninformed. To illustrate the scope for zero-sum thinking, we envision that λ is small, which implies that, with high likelihood, all three voters view policy p∗to be superior. Nevertheless, each voter’s uncertainty about what the other vot- ers have learned results in a strict equilibrium that selects policy p∗with high probability. That equilibrium involves the following behavior: • An informed loser votes p∗and an informed winner votes p∗; • An uninformed voter votes p∗. 3See https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/19/nigel-farage-brexit-party-on-the-road-populism and https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/nigel-farage-basks-in-the-triumph-of-his-new-dawn. 4More broadly, pertaining to trade, most estimates show that the US-China trade war that began in 2018 has been costly for the average U.S. household (Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2022)). Autor, Beck, Dorn, and Hanson (2024) found that, contrary to the zero-sum perspective, this trade war did not actually increase em- ployment of American workers, even in the places where the newly-protected industries were located; however, it strengthened political support for the Republican party, particularly in those areas. 5Throughout our analysis, we focus on weakly undominated equilibria.', 'We explain why this behavior constitutes an equilibrium. As an informed voter votes for her strictly preferred policy, it sufﬁces to consider the incentives of an uninformed voter, say Ann. Her vote affects her payoff only if it breaks a tie: of Bella and Carol, one votes p∗ and the other votes p∗. Given the stipulated behavior, Ann knows that only an informed winner would vote for p∗. By contrast, the vote for p∗may be cast by an uninformed voter (just like Ann) or an informed loser. For λ ≈0, Ann ascribes much higher probability to the former event. In this case, she and the other uninformed voter have an equal chance of being the remaining winner. Hence, whenever her vote is decisive, Ann believes that she is a winner with probability one-half, lower than the ex ante odds of two-thirds. At these interim odds, Ann ﬁnds it strictly optimal to vote p∗, ratifying that the strategy proﬁle is a strict equilibrium.6 That is, when uninformed voters fear that support for policy p∗comes from others who are better informed, they ﬁnd it optimal to vote p∗, thereby reinforcing the initial suspicion. Observe that if λ ≈0, all voters are likely uninformed. As they all vote p∗, that policy wins with near certainty. This outcome contrasts with what prevails in the no-information benchmark. It also contrasts with what would be chosen if all signals were realized pub- licly; in that setting, policy p∗would win with near certainty as voters would see that they all are uninformed and therefore vote for the ex ante optimal policy. Hence, both ex ante and with public information, voters have aligned preferences and favor policy p∗. This example suggests a strategic rationale for the prevalence of zero-sum thinking even in settings where voter preferences are largely aligned. Our analysis evaluates more broadly when asymmetric information leads to such outcomes. We go beyond the exam- ple in several respects, the most important being that our general model allows uncer- tainty about how many voters beneﬁt from the ex ante optimal policy. To isolate the role of asymmetric information, we start with the benchmark in which all voters share the same information and ex ante preferences; the unique equilibrium (in weakly undomi- nated strategies) then selects the optimal policy. We compare that benchmark with an “informationally-scarce” setting in which each voter obtains additional private informa- tion with a small probability.7 Our analysis evaluates when the prospect of asymmetric information leads the electorate astray. As we show, the question boils down to how an uninformed voter, say Ann, views a policy when she conditions on others learning that the policy beneﬁts them. Should she see the good news for others as good or bad news for herself? On one hand, others may receive good news about a policy because the policy results in many winners, which im- proves her odds of being a winner also. This force of advantageous selection is potent if uncertainty about the number of winners trumps distributional uncertainty, for example, in a pure common-value election where either all voters gain or all lose from a policy. The second force is adverse selection: for any given number of winners, Ann’s odds of being a winner reduce when others receive good news. This crowding-out effect features in our example above where the number of winners is ﬁxed. 6The probability that Ann is a winner, conditional on being pivotal, is 1 2−λ , and she has a strict incentive to vote p∗if λ < 1 3 . 7We focus on informationally-scarce settings for primarily two reasons. Conceptually, this study describes settings in which voters, being mostly uninformed, agree with high probability on which policy is better. Thus, it homes in on the prospect for zero-sum thinking in positive-sum policy choices. We also view this focus to be reasonable from the applied perspective that it is often difﬁcult for voters to know or predict the impact of policies. We elaborate on this motivation in Sections 2.2 and 6, and also study a setting with abundant information in Section 4.1.', 'More generally, which force dominates hinges on how a voter’s payoff correlates with the signals of other voters. We call the collective choice problem adversely correlated if the adverse selection effect dominates and otherwise deem it advantageously correlated; each is a condition on primitives. Our main result (Theorem 1) characterizes how correlation shapes equilibrium behavior in informationally-scarce settings. Stated informally, it ﬁnds that the following holds. MAIN RESULT: If the collective choice problem is adversely correlated, there is a strict equi- librium that selects the ex ante inferior policy with near certainty. Otherwise, every equilibrium selects the ex ante optimal policy with near certainty. Adverse correlation is thus a source of political fragility as elections may then select a policy that would not be chosen were all voters known to be uninformed. The strategic logic reﬂects zero-sum thinking, whereby a sufﬁciently large group of uninformed voters vote for the inferior policy for fear of what other voters have learned. Not all equilib- ria select the inferior policy: there also exists an equilibrium in which the optimal policy wins.8 But, nevertheless, elections may not pick the right outcome and collective choice hinges on voters’ ability to coordinate on a “good” equilibrium. By contrast, if the col- lective choice problem is advantageously correlated, such coordination is obviated; all equilibria—pure or mixed, symmetric or asymmetric—result in the optimal policy.9 For expositional clarity, we consider a model with a ﬁxed number of voters, all of whom are ex ante symmetric, aggregating votes by simple-majority rule. But the strategic ratio- nale for zero-sum thinking applies beyond this setting. Similar results hold for other vot- ing rules, imposing a restriction to symmetric equilibria, and with an electorate of random size. Moreover, ex ante asymmetries only amplify the tendency for zero-sum thinking. We also show that informational scarcity is not necessary: information can be relatively abun- dant and yet zero-sum thinking may still push the electorate to select the inferior policy with high probability, even in a large electorate. The condition of adverse correlation lends itself to comparative statics. We show that policy choices that are more polarizing, in terms of the proportional loss suffered by losers relative to the gains that accrue to winners, have a greater potential to induce adverse correlation. We also formulate the “crowding-out effect” from learning that others are winners in terms of the standard likelihood-ratio dominance order. These results reveal features that make elections more prone to zero-sum thinking. Our analysis also identiﬁes informational drivers of zero-sum thinking. If voters were to learn only about aggregate outcomes—in our model, the number of winners, but more broadly, say, aggregate GDP or economic growth—then the collective choice problem cannot be adversely correlated. By contrast, purely distributional information that identi- ﬁes who is ﬁrst in line to obtain gains induces adverse correlation. This contrast dovetails with analyses of how media outlets proﬁt from selling information that polarizes rather than uniﬁes voters (Martin and Yurukoglu (2017), Perego and Yuksel (2022)). Our results call attention to a pernicious “downstream” effect of this market competition on voting behavior. 8For instance, in the example, there also exists an equilibrium in which all uninformed voters vote for p∗. 9From this standpoint, our work connects to the growing interest in institutional design under adversarial equilibrium selection, as in Mathevet, Perego, and Taneva (2020), Halac, Lipnowski, and Rappoport (2021), Ali, Haghpanah, Lin, and Siegel (2022), Inostroza and Pavan (2024), and others.', 'We outline the remainder of our paper. Section 2 describes the general model and Section 3 our main results. Section 4 unpacks our correlation conditions to see what fea- tures render collective choice more adversely correlated. Section 5 considers extensions. Section 6 views various political episodes through the lens of our model. Section 7 con- cludes. Omitted proofs are in the Appendix and the Supplemental Appendix (). The rest of this Introduction places our work within the context of the broader literature. Related Literature. This paper contributes to the understanding of distrust and zero- sum thinking in politics, an issue that has been studied from various perspectives. Re- search in social psychology (Meegan (2010), Ró˙zycka-Tran, Boski, and Wojciszke (2015), Davidai and Ongis (2019)) documents the prevalence of zero-sum thinking. Within eco- nomics, Chinoy et al. (2024) found that both Democrat and Republican voters engage in zero-sum thinking, and that those who exhibit a greater tendency to do so also support more redistribution and stricter immigration controls.10 While this body of work largely views zero-sum thinking as a psychological trait, we provide a complementary perspec- tive that shows how this worldview emerges in settings in which rational voters worry that others have an informational advantage. A beneﬁt of our approach is that it sheds light on features of a policy choice that moderate or amplify the tendency to see the world in zero-sum terms. Zero-sum thinking is closely connected to polarization and populism. Research on po- larization, surveyed by Iyengar, Lelkes, Levendusky, Malhotra, and Westwood (2019), shows that supporters of each U.S. political party distrust members of the other party, reﬂecting potentially both partisan animus and the perception that policies advanced by one party are detrimental to the other. Furthermore, the work on false polarization (e.g., Levendusky and Malhotra (2016)) documents that voters overestimate their degree of polarization. Porting that ﬁnding to our context suggests that even if a collective choice problem is advantageously correlated, voters might incorrectly perceive it to be adversely correlated, which would magnify the scope for zero-sum thinking. Populism also features zero-sum thinking given that one of its deﬁning characteristics is “anti-elitism” (Mudde (2004), Guriev and Papaioannou (2022)). Our baseline model does not distinguish be- tween elite and non-elite voters, but our extension in Section 5.3 shows that these distinc- tions only amplify the strategic forces in our model. Numerous studies model populism, through the channel of signaling (Acemoglu, Egorov, and Sonin (2013)), identity poli- tics (Bonomi, Gennaioli, and Tabellini (2021)), inequality aversion (Pástor and Veronesi (2021)), or misspeciﬁed beliefs (Eliaz and Spiegler (2020), Levy, Razin, and Young (2022), Szeidl and Szucs (2024)). Our model offers a complementary perspective, showing that asymmetric information may spur completely rational voters to distrust each other even in settings where interests are largely aligned. Fernandez and Rodrik (1991), an important precursor, showed that a reform that ben- eﬁts a majority of voters ex post may nevertheless fail ex ante if the expected payoff from the resulting lottery is not worthwhile for a majority of voters. Their model does not feature asymmetric information nor aggregate uncertainty about the number of winners; 10 also found evidence suggestive of zero-sum thinking in that across a range of experimental treatments on adverse and advantageous selection, subjects distrust better-informed partners who have conﬂicting interests but fail to trust those with aligned interests.  used an evolutionary model to show that zero-sum interactions lead to belief systems that demotivate effort.', 'roughly put, the reasoning reﬂects zero-sum thinking in a zero-sum setting. In their set- ting, the ex ante optimal policy always wins. We show that asymmetric information ampli- ﬁes the scope for political failures. The fear of what other voters have learned leads voters to choose a policy they deem ex ante inferior, that is, zero-sum thinking in a positive-sum setting. Our work also contributes to the literature on the “swing voter’s curse,” which studies how voting behavior is inﬂuenced by asymmetric information. Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1996) showed that, if voter interests are completely aligned, an uninformed voter might strategically abstain so as to leave the decision to better informed voters.11 In our analysis, the potential for misaligned interests implies that an uninformed voter might not defer to and, a fortiori, might wish to act against those who are better informed.12 A few papers in this literature (Kim and Fey (2007), Bhattacharya (2013), Acharya (2016)) show that misaligned interests could disrupt information aggregation in large elections, assuming voter types are conditionally independent.13 While our work and theirs share some com- mon threads, our focus on distributional considerations and zero-sum thinking requires a setup in which voters’ type is inherently correlated. Our results also speak to the robust- ness and fragility of collective choice to asymmetric information rather than information aggregation per se. By highlighting how zero-sum thinking makes collective choice fragile, our analysis offers a complementary perspective on how asymmetric information shapes voting behavior. Our interest in fragility connects to the study of global games and higher-order beliefs (Carlsson and van Damme (1993), Kajii and Morris (1997)). Closer to our work, Morris and Song Shin (2012) found that small amounts of private information can disrupt asset markets through adverse selection. While related, the fragility modeled in this literature departs from that which we study. Prior work shows that higher-order uncertainty renders some equilibrium outcomes of complete information games untenable in nearby incom- plete information games; that is, the equilibrium outcome correspondence is not lower hemicontinuous. By contrast, we ﬁnd that incomplete information games with scarce pri- vate information generate equilibrium outcomes that do not obtain in the complete infor- mation game. Formally, the outcome correspondence of weakly undominated equilibria is not upper hemicontinuous. As we show, second-order uncertainty alone triggers this discontinuity. 2. MODEL 2.1. Setup The Collective Choice Problem. A group of voters N :={1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n}uses simple-majority rule to choose between two policies, p∗and p∗. For simplicity, we assume that n is odd so that policy p wins with strictly more than τ := n−1 2 votes. 11They also modeled settings in which one policy might enjoy greater support from “partisan” dominant- action types. They showed that “independent” uninformed voters might counter that partisan bias by tilting their votes toward the other policy. In this way, their analysis could rationalize uninformed voters voting for a policy they deem inferior based on all that they know. Austen-Smith and Banks (1996) and Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1998) modeled similar effects in pure common-value settings in which, given the prior beliefs, the voting rule tilts in favor of one policy. 12Formally, under adverse correlation, the equilibrium that we construct in Theorem 1 would remain even if voters could abstain. 13The literature also studies other obstacles to information aggregation; see, for instance, Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1997), Razin (2003), Ekmekci and Lauermann (2020), and Barelli, Bhattacharya, and Siga (2022).', 'Voters are uncertain about their payoffs from each policy. A payoff for voter i is a tuple vi = (v p∗ i \\x03v p∗ i ) ∈V := Vp∗× Vp∗, where Vp is a ﬁnite set of potential payoffs from policy p. Before casting her vote, voter i receives a private signal si drawn from a ﬁnite set of signals S := {s0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03sK}. A state of the world ω comprises a payoff proﬁle v ∈Vn and a signal proﬁle s ∈Sn. Uncertainty is described by a probability distribution P on the state space \\x07 := Vn × Sn. The random variable V p denotes the payoff proﬁle from choosing policy p and S denotes the signal proﬁle.14 The population of voters and the probability space together deﬁne the collective choice problem. Our baseline framework makes three assumptions. For the ﬁrst assumption, we say that state (v′\\x03s′) permutes state (v\\x03s) if there is a one-to-one mapping ψ : N →N such that (v′ i\\x03s′ i) = (vψ(i)\\x03sψ(i)) for all i ∈N . ASSUMPTION 1: Voters are exchangeable: if ω′ permutes ω, then P(ω′) = P(ω). Exchangeability focuses attention on the conﬂict generated by asymmetric information rather than heterogeneous ex ante preferences; we relax this assumption in Section 5.3. Given Assumption 1, all voters agree on the (ex ante) optimal policy. Without loss of generality, we assume that p∗is the (ex ante) optimal policy and p∗is the (ex ante) inferior policy.15 We deﬁne the random variable V d := V p∗−V p∗to denote the proﬁle of payoff differences between these two policies. For a non-null event E ⊆\\x07, we write voter i’s conditional payoff difference as V d i (E) := \\x02 ω∈\\x07 \\x03 V p∗ i (ω) −V p∗ i (ω) \\x04 P(ω|E)\\x05 If E is null, we deﬁne V d i (E) = 0 to simplify exposition. Our second assumption distinguishes signal s0, which is uninformative, from the remain- ing signals M :={s1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03sK}, which are informative. ASSUMPTION 2: Signal s0 is uninformative and every other signal is sufﬁcient to deduce the ex post ordinal preference: for all (v\\x03s) ∈\\x07, (a) if si = s0, then P(v\\x03s) = P(v\\x03s−i)P(si); and (b) if si ̸= s0, then V d i (s) > 0 if and only if V d i (si) > 0. Assumption 2(a) asserts that signal s0 realizes independently of the payoff pro- ﬁle and the other signals, and hence conveys no information about these variables. Assumption 2(b) speaks to the informativeness of the remaining signals: for a voter who obtains an informative signal, learning the signals of others conveys no additional infor- mation about her ordinal preference over policies. Hence, relative to the entire signal proﬁle s, the private signal si is sufﬁcient to deduce voter i’s preferred policy. A special case is where the informed signal reveals directly one’s cardinal payoffs from each pol- icy, as in our introductory example. Assumption 2(b) goes beyond this special case by encompassing settings in which informed voters do not know all that much about their 14In general, capital letters denote random variables and lowercase letters denote realizations. For random variable X, {x} := {ω : X(ω) = x} is the event where x is realized, omitting the brackets when clear from the context. 15These policies could correspond to actual policy choices, as in a referendum, or to candidates standing in an election. For instance, policy p∗may represent an incumbent politician and policy p∗a challenger with little political experience.', 'cardinal payoffs but are just well-informed relative to the electorate about their ordinal preferences. We exploit this generality in Section 4. Among the informative signals, we say that signal sk conveys good news if V d i (Si = sk) > 0 and bad news if V d i (Si = sk) < 0. Being ordinal, these notions convey whether an in- formed voter favors the ex ante optimal policy. For a signal proﬁle s ∈Sn, M(s) is the number of voters who receive informative signals, G(s) is the number with good news, and B(s) is the number with bad news. Our ﬁnal assumption simpliﬁes exposition without playing a substantive role. ASSUMPTION 3: Voters have strict preferences and both bad news and good news are pos- sible: (a) For every voter i ∈N and non-null event E ⊆\\x07, V d i (E) ̸= 0. (b) P(B ≥1) > 0 and P(G ≥τ) > 0. Assumption 3(a) obviates the need to describe how voters behave when indifferent and, with ﬁnitely many states, strict preferences are generic in the space of possible payoff proﬁles. Assumption 3(b) rules out some trivial cases: when it is impossible to receive bad signals, voting for the inferior policy is a weakly dominated strategy; if P(G ≥τ) = 0, there is always an uninteresting equilibrium where all uninformed voters select the inferior policy only because their votes are then never decisive. This completes the description of the baseline collective choice problem. We contrast behavior in this collective choice problem with private information to that in a public information benchmark, where every voter observes the entire signal proﬁle s. Solution Concept. A strategy for a voter is a signal-contingent probability of voting for p∗. We study Bayes Nash equilibria in weakly undominated strategies, which implies that those with good news vote for p∗and those with bad news vote for p∗. Henceforth, we refer to these as equilibria. The following summarizes equilibrium existence in the baseline collective choice problem and the public information benchmark. PROPOSITION 1: An equilibrium exists under both private and public information; in the latter case, the equilibrium is unique. 2.2. Scarce Information We primarily model settings in which information is “scarce”: namely, all else equal, the probability that a voter obtains the uninformative signal, s0, is relatively high. We describe below what scarce information entails and then brieﬂy discuss our motivation. To understand how we model scarce information, suppose that signals are drawn ac- cording to the following two-stage process: ﬁrst, a probability distribution chooses a state in which every voter obtains an informative signal; and second, for each voter i, her sig- nal is “deleted” with some independent probability, which results in her obtaining the uninformative signal. For the ﬁrst stage, let PI(·) := P(·|S ∈Mn) denote the probability distribution over states conditional on all voters receiving informative signals. For the sec- ond stage, let λ := P(Si ∈M) denote the probability that a voter’s signal is not deleted. Lemma 1 in the Appendix shows that the model of Section 2 embodies this two-stage process: under Assumptions 1 and 2(a), the probability distribution P decomposes into a pair (PI\\x03λ). This decomposition permits us to vary λ while all other variables, governed by PI, are held ﬁxed. Information is then scarce if λ is small. We deﬁne what it means for a policy to win under these circumstances.', 'DEFINITION 1: Policy p wins in an equilibrium with scarce information if, for every ε in (0\\x031), there exists λε in (0\\x031) such that, for all λ in (0\\x03λε), policy p wins with probability at least 1 −ε in an equilibrium of the collective choice problem (N \\x03\\x07\\x03PI\\x03λ). Deﬁnition 1 ﬁxes an informed collective choice problem PI and studies equilibrium outcomes of the “diluted” collective choice problem (PI\\x03λ), in which a voter obtains an uninformative signal with high probability, (1 −λ), and obtains a signal according to PI with a low probability, λ. We focus on electoral outcomes with scarce private information, which we compare with the benchmark of scarce public information described below. PROPOSITION 2: In the public information benchmark, policy p∗wins in the unique equi- librium with scarce information. The logic of Proposition 2 is that under scarce information, all voters are likely un- informed, and in this benchmark, that event is publicly observed. Therefore, each voter casts her vote for p∗, thereby securing its victory. Proposition 2 offers the sense in which we view the policy choice to be positive-sum: were all information public, all voters would likely have fully aligned interests. Against that backdrop, our main analysis evaluates how uninformed voters behave once they do not know what others have learned. Apart from these conceptual reasons, we also view scarce information to be relevant from an applied perspective. Many policy choices are inherently vague or complex, which makes it difﬁcult for most voters to anticipate policy consequences. Moreover, given the recent proliferation of noisy news and media sources, each voter may be exposed to only a few information sources and not know what other voters learn.16 Our analysis speaks to how zero-sum thinking can prevail in such environments, where a majority of voters are largely uninformed but suspicious that others might have an informational advantage. 3. THE FRAGILITY OF COLLECTIVE CHOICE 3.1. Adverse Correlation At the core of zero-sum thinking is the question: is good news for others also good news for me? The answer depends on how a voter’s payoff is correlated with others’ signals. Consider a voter, Ann, who receives the uninformative signal. Based on only her own information, the ex ante optimal remains optimal. Now suppose that she conditions on κ voters obtaining good news and no voter obtaining bad news. Her conditional expected payoff difference is then V G(κ) := V d i \\x03 G = κ\\x03B = 0\\x03Si = s0\\x04 \\x03 that is, the expected payoff difference between the optimal and inferior policies condi- tioning on Ann receiving the uninformative signal, κ others receiving good news, and no one receiving bad news.17 We elaborate on the interpretation of this term. First, this posterior expected payoff considers an event in which no voter obtains bad news; our analysis in Section 3.2 con- ﬁrms that such events play an important role in equilibrium behavior. Second, in principle, 16While Assumption 1(a) frames signal s0 as completely uninformative, our analysis is compatible with set- tings in which all signals are at least slightly informative. 17We observe that V G depends only on PI and does not vary with λ.', 'it is unclear if Ann favors policy p∗more or less once she conditions on κ other voters obtaining good news. On one hand, the likelihood of drawing κ good signals from κ ran- dom draws is higher if policy p∗is likely to beneﬁt many voters. On the other hand, for any given number of beneﬁciaries, Anne’s chances of beneﬁting from p∗herself is lower once κ “slots” are already taken by others. These effects push in opposing directions, one bearing on aggregate considerations and the other on distributional considerations. The sign of V G(κ) varies with κ, depending on which effect dominates. For example, if no voter obtains good news (κ = 0), the posterior expected payoff difference coincides with the prior expected payoff difference, which is strictly positive. Once some voters obtain good news, the sign depends on the relative importance of the aggregate and dis- tributional considerations. Our introductory example features only distributional uncer- tainty and V G(κ) < 0 for every κ > 0; knowing that anyone else obtained good news in- duces Ann to favor the inferior policy. By contrast, when voter preferences are perfectly aligned—as in a common-value problem—then there is only aggregate uncertainty in that all voters gain or all lose from policy p∗. In that case, V G(κ) > 0 for every κ > 0. Our correlation condition assesses if V G is negative for a relevant domain. DEFINITION 2: The collective choice problem is adversely correlated if there is some κ in {1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}such that V G(κ) < 0. Otherwise, the collective choice problem is advantageously correlated.18 Recall that τ := (n −1)/2 is the number of votes for policy p∗that makes a voter piv- otal. The criterion above evaluates if there is any coalition of weakly smaller size whose good news, on net, makes an uninformed voter favor the inferior policy p∗. This criterion jointly evaluates the payoff and information structure: as we show in Section 4, ﬁxing a distribution of payoffs, some information structures render the collective choice problem adversely correlated whereas others make it advantageously correlated. Likewise, ﬁxing an information structure, payoffs can determine whether the collective choice problem is adversely or advantageously correlated. 3.2. Main Result We show that the fragility of collective choice hinges on its correlation. THEOREM 1: The inferior policy p∗wins in a strict equilibrium with scarce information if the collective choice problem is adversely correlated. Otherwise, the optimal policy p∗wins in every equilibrium with scarce information. Recall that were each voter known to be uninformed, or if all information were pub- lic and scarce, every equilibrium would select policy p∗: without private information, the electorate faces a positive-sum policy choice in which the optimal policy receives unani- mous support. Theorem 1 shows, by contrast, that the slightest prospect of private infor- mation could result in a different equilibrium outcome. Voting behavior is fragile to pri- vate information whenever the collective choice problem is adversely correlated: formally, the outcome correspondence of weakly undominated equilibria violates upper hemicon- tinuity as λ →0. Conversely, advantageous correlation assures robustness. Not only does 18By Assumption 3(a), advantageous correlation equates to V G(κ) > 0 for every κ in {1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}.', 'the optimal policy p∗win with non-trivial odds, it does so with near certainty in any equi- librium, pure or mixed, asymmetric or symmetric.19 To see how adverse correlation results in policy p∗winning the election, we start with the simplest case, namely V G(τ) < 0. Then, a strict equilibrium akin to that of our intro- ductory example implements the inferior policy: all uninformed voters vote for policy p∗. An uninformed Ann infers, conditional on being pivotal, that τ voters have voted for pol- icy p∗. By construction, each of these voters must have heard good news. As information is scarce, Ann believes all those who voted for p∗are likely uninformed, that is, the number of voters who received bad news is likely 0. Her expected payoff difference conditional on being pivotal then approximates V G(τ) < 0, which implies that she strictly prefers to vote for policy p∗. Because most voters are uninformed, it wins with high probability. Other cases require more elaborate constructions. Let V G(τ) > 0 and κ∗be the highest value of κ in {1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ} such that V G(κ) < 0. We construct a (strict) pure-strategy equi- librium that is asymmetric. In this equilibrium, we label some voters as “suspicious” and all others as “sanguine.” A suspicious (resp., sanguine) voter casts her vote for policy p∗ (resp., p∗) when she is uninformed. We specify that (τ −κ∗) voters are sanguine and all others are suspicious. Our argument establishing that this is an equilibrium hews to the following logic: • A suspicious uninformed voter, conditional on being pivotal, places high odds on the event where (i) of the τ votes for policy p∗, (τ −κ∗) are cast by uninformed sanguine voters and the remaining κ∗votes are cast by suspicious voters who obtained good news; (ii) all the (n −τ −1) votes for policy p∗are cast by uninformed suspicious voters. Hence, her conditional expected payoff difference is close to V G(κ∗) < 0. Thus, she strictly prefers to vote for policy p∗. • A sanguine uninformed voter makes a different calculation that stems from her being sanguine: conditional on being pivotal, she puts high odds that of the τ votes for policy p∗, (τ −κ∗−1) are cast by uninformed sanguine voters and (κ∗+ 1) votes are cast by suspicious voters who obtained good news. Hence, her conditional expected payoff difference is close to V G(κ∗+ 1), which is strictly positive as κ∗is the highest value of κ such that V G(κ) < 0. Thus, she strictly prefers to vote for policy p∗. Having argued that the strategy proﬁle is an equilibrium, we note that as λ →0, the election is likely decided by the uninformed voters. Given that sanguine voters are in a minority, the inferior policy p∗wins with near certainty. Theorem 1 also asserts that under advantageous correlation, the optimal policy pre- vails in every equilibrium with near certainty. Hence, adverse correlation is also necessary for electoral failures. This direction is considerably more challenging to prove given the large number of candidate equilibria, including those that are asymmetric and in mixed strategies. The key idea is that as private information becomes scarce, for any weakly undominated strategy proﬁle, the relevant posterior payoff of an uninformed voter ap- proximates a weighted sum of V G(κ) evaluated at different values of κ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}. The speciﬁc weights depend on the strategy proﬁle but, regardless of the weights, advanta- geous correlation implies that the sum is strictly positive because V G(κ) > 0 for every κ. 19An equivalent way to frame our results is through the lens of public and private information. Suppose that all voters obtain noisy public information that indicates that policy p∗is superior. If it were commonly known that no voter obtains any additional private information, the electorate would use this public information to select policy p∗in every weakly undominated equilibrium. However, if some voters obtain additional private information with even the slightest chance, under adverse correlation, there is an equilibrium in which the electorate fails to use public information to select the better policy. Thus, a better informed electorate might make worse choices when some of that better information is received privately by voters.', 'Hence, the decisions of others in any equilibrium never generate enough bad news to sway uninformed voters to vote for policy p∗with non-trivial probability. In light of our main result, the reader may wonder if adverse correlation nevertheless accommodates a “good” equilibrium that selects the optimal policy? Yes. THEOREM 2: Regardless of correlation, policy p∗wins in at least some equilibrium with scarce information. The logic of Theorem 2 is that although the information structure is a primitive of the collective choice problem, how an uninformed voter interprets others’ votes is determined in equilibrium. Our construction in Theorem 1 sways an uninformed Ann toward policy p∗by having most votes in favor of policy p∗to be cast by those who have good news so that, under adverse correlation, policy p∗is selected adversely to her interests. By the same logic, a strategy proﬁle in which most votes in favor of policy p∗are cast by those who have bad news could make policy p∗selected adversely to Ann’s interests, which would push Ann to vote for policy p∗. Our proof of Theorem 2 shows that the ex ante inferiority of policy p∗implies that it is always feasible to construct such an equilibrium. As uninformed voters overwhelmingly vote for policy p∗in that equilibrium, it wins when information is scarce. Theorem 2 suggests that fragility is not a concern if voters can coordinate on equilibria that maximize ex ante welfare. We take the perspective that presuming voter coordina- tion is not modest, particularly in large electorates or in the absence of an ex ante stage at which all voters are known to be symmetrically informed. Theorem 1 implies that, under adverse correlation, voter coordination is necessary to avoid an inferior outcome that is rationalized by neither voters’ information nor their preferences; the prospect of asym- metric information, however slight, can result in this perverse outcome. By contrast, ad- vantageous correlation obviates voter coordination as the optimal policy is assured across all equilibria. Our analysis applies beyond our baseline setting. We assume simple-majority rule but our analysis invokes it only for simplicity. Suppose that policy p∗passes if it obtains at least τ + 1 votes where τ is now any number in {1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n −1}. We would continue to de- ﬁne adverse and advantageous correlation as per Deﬁnition 2, and Theorem 1 still holds. Therefore, increasing the number of votes required for policy p∗to pass only expands the set of parameters for which adverse correlation holds. Section 5 describes elaborations that require further analysis. A similar characteriza- tion obtains for symmetric equilibria under a slightly different correlation condition; that analysis also accommodates population uncertainty. We also relax the condition that vot- ers are ex ante symmetric, allowing for some voters to be “elites” who are more likely to beneﬁt from the optimal policy. We show that this ex ante conﬂict only ampliﬁes the forces described here. Before describing these extensions, we focus on a tractable class of the baseline model to identify various sources of adverse correlation. 4. SOURCES OF ADVERSE CORRELATION In this section, we study features of a collective choice problem that lead to adverse correlation. For this comparison, we focus on a class of collective choice problem with binary payoffs: V d i ∈{vw\\x03−vℓ} for some vw and vℓstrictly positive, so that each voter’s ex post payoff from p∗is either vw higher or vℓlower than that from p∗.20 The event Wi := 20For instance, \\x07 ={vw\\x03−vℓ}n ×{0}n × Sn for some vw > 0 and vℓ> 0.', '{ω : V d i (ω) > 0} comprises all states where voter i gains from policy p∗, and is referred to as a winner. The number of winners in state ω is W (ω) :=|{i ∈N : ω ∈Wi}|. As policy p∗ is ex ante optimal, we are assuming throughout that P(Wi)vw −(1 −P(Wi))vℓ> 0. In this class of collective choice problems, we study how varying the payoffs, the proba- bility distribution on the number of winners, and the nature of the information conveyed by signals affects the correlation structure. 4.1. Polarization Ratios and the Crowding-Out Effect We ﬁrst ﬁx a simple information structure to focus on payoffs: suppose that informative signals convey perfect news in that an informed voter learns if she is a winner or loser, that is, P(Wi|Si = sk) ∈{0\\x031} for each informative signal sk. The collective choice problem can then be represented through the tuple (PW \\x03v) where PW is the (marginal) distribution on the number of winners, PW : {0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n} →[0\\x031], and v := (vw\\x03vℓ) speciﬁes the ex post payoff differences. We write V G(κ;PW \\x03v) as the value of V G(κ) for this collective choice problem, and order collective choice problems by their propensity for adverse correlation. DEFINITION 3: A collective choice problem (PW \\x03v) is more adversely correlated than the collective choice problem (P′ W \\x03v′) if, for every κ ∈{1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}, V G\\x03 κ|P′ W \\x03v′\\x04 < 0 =⇒ V G(κ|PW \\x03v) < 0\\x05 We denote this binary relation by ≽AC.21 We identify two sources of adverse correlation. The ﬁrst views payoffs through their polarization ratio: given binary payoffs (vw\\x03vℓ), the polarization ratio vℓ/vw measures the proportional costs incurred by losers relative to the gains that accrue to winners. The sec- ond views the crowding-out effect through likelihood ratios: the probability distribution P′ W likelihood-ratio dominates PW , denoted P′ W ≽LR PW , if P′ W (w′)PW (w) ≥P′ W (w)PW (w′) whenever w′ > w. PROPOSITION 3: The following comparative statics results hold: (a) A higher polarization ratio induces more adverse correlation: (PW \\x03v) ≽AC (PW \\x03v′) if vℓ/vw ≥v′ ℓ/v′ w. (b) Likelihood-ratio dominance induces less adverse correlation: (P′ W \\x03v) ≽AC (PW \\x03v) if PW ≽LR P′ W . A higher polarization ratio increases adverse correlation because, relative to the infe- rior policy p∗, a higher polarization ratio worsens the gamble from the optimal policy p∗both ex ante and ex interim. By contrast, a likelihood-ratio dominant increase in the marginal distribution over the number of winners has the opposite effect because it re- duces crowding-out from learning that others received good news. In combination with Theorem 1, Proposition 3 implies that increasing the polarization ratio or reducing the likelihood ratio makes collective choice more fragile to asymmetric information. An implication of Proposition 3 is that redistributive programs may alleviate zero-sum thinking. Coupling policy p∗with transfers from winners to losers would lower the polar- ization ratio and mitigate the concern of crowding-out. Concretely, if trade expansion is 21We note that ≽AC is a preorder in that it is reﬂexive and transitive but not complete.', 'accompanied by retraining programs for displaced workers, then a referendum on a trade agreement may be more likely to pass as the collective choice problem would then be less adversely correlated. Redistribution can transform an adversely correlated collective choice problem into one that is advantageously correlated. A Large Election Analysis. We build on this analysis of crowding-out behavior to show that zero-sum thinking may prevail even when information is abundant. For this analysis, we hold the primitives ﬁxed and study behavior as the population size n →∞, assuming throughout that n is odd. Our focus here is on distributional uncertainty and the crowding- out effect so, as in the introductory example, we ﬁx the proportion of winners: there is some q in [1/2\\x031) such that in the election with n voters, there are ⌈qn⌉winners. Policy p∗ being ex ante optimal for every n is then equivalent to the polarization ratio, vℓ/vw, being strictly less than q/(1 −q). We identify a critical polarization ratio that determines if adverse or advantageous cor- relation holds in a large election: using {τn} to denote the event where n−1 2 voters receive good news and no voter receives bad news, the critical polarization ratio is ρ := lim n→∞ Pn \\x03 Wi|{τn} \\x04 1 −Pn \\x03 Wi|{τn} \\x04 = q −1 2 1 −q \\x05 Our ﬁrst result connects this critical polarization ratio to adverse correlation in large elec- tions. PROPOSITION 4: If vℓ/vw > ρ, then there exists N such that, for all n > N, the n-voter collective choice problem has adverse correlation; otherwise, for every n, the n-voter collective choice problem has advantageous correlation. Proposition 4 obtains a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for adverse correlation in all sufﬁciently large elections. We use this result to characterize electoral outcomes in a large election. PROPOSITION 5: If vℓ/vw > ρ, there exists λ∗> 0 such that, for all λ < λ∗, the inferior policy wins in a strict equilibrium of a large election.22 Otherwise, for every population size n and λ in (0\\x031), the optimal policy wins with probability 1 in every equilibrium. Hence, if there is adverse correlation, the inferior policy wins with near certainty in a strict equilibrium of a large election; otherwise, the optimal policy wins with certainty in every equilibrium for every population size. We note several features of this result. First, it ﬁxes a λ > 0 and then takes n →∞. The order of limits therefore differs from that of Theorem 1. Information need not be scarce and may actually be abundant. We show in the proof that λ∗≥1 −(vℓ/vw)−1ρ. Using the parameters of the introductory example, namely q = 2/3, vℓ= 3, and vw = 2, the inferior policy wins in a strict equilibrium of a large election for any λ ∈(0\\x03 2/3). Hence, it may even be more likely that voters are informed than uninformed, and nonetheless, the inferior policy wins. Second, as the bound 1 −(vℓ/vw)−1ρ indicates, increasing the 22Formally, for every ε in (0\\x031), there exists Nε such that, for all n > Nε, there is a strict equilibrium of the n-voter collective choice problem in which the inferior policy wins with probability at least 1 −ε.', 'polarization ratio only expands the region in which the inferior policy wins. Third, ﬁxing all other parameters, increasing the population size may expand the range of λ for which there is an equilibrium in which all uninformed voters vote for p∗. This effect is evident in our introductory example: for n = 3, this equilibrium exists if λ is in (0\\x03 1/3), whereas if n is sufﬁciently large, the equilibrium exists whenever λ is in (0\\x03 2/3). Finally, a large election makes it even more likely that policy p∗wins in a large election.23 Thus, in a large election with abundant information, zero-sum thinking may not only prevail but also be even more pronounced. 4.2. Aggregate and Distributional Information Electoral choices are also shaped by the kind of information voters obtain. Contrast the following messages by Republican Presidents about the economic consequences of trade liberalization: “Free trade serves the cause of economic progress. . . ”—Reagan, 1982 “Members of the club—the consultants, the pollsters, the politicians, the pundits, and the special interests— grow rich and powerful while the American people grow poorer and more isolated. . . ”—Trump, 2016 The former emphasizes aggregate consequences without referring to who beneﬁts and loses, whereas the latter focuses on those distributional consequences without speaking about aggregate gains. Politicians and media outlets can choose between focusing their messaging on aggregate or distributional consequences. Here, we identify how this choice affects voting behavior. To this end, we depart from the perfect news considered in Section 4.1. Instead, we say that signals convey only aggregate news if P(V = v|S = s\\x03W = w) = P(V = v|W = w) for any payoff proﬁle v, signal proﬁle s, and number of winners w such that P(W = w) > 0. That is, conditioning on the number of winners, voters learn nothing further about the payoffs from their signals. PROPOSITION 6: Suppose signals convey only aggregate news. Then, for every polarization ratio, the collective choice problem is advantageously correlated. We contrast this case with one where signals convey only distributional news: P(W = w|S = s) = P(W = w) for any signal proﬁle s and number of winners w, that is, signals are uninformative about the number of winners. PROPOSITION 7: Suppose signals convey only distributional news. Then, holding the sig- nal structure ﬁxed, there is a polarization ratio ˆρ such that the collective choice problem is adversely correlated whenever vℓ/vw ≥ˆρ.24 The contrast between Propositions 6 and 7 reveals how the information structure may preclude or induce adverse correlation by focusing on aggregate or distributional news. This ﬁnding dovetails with Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) and Perego and Yuksel (2022) who showed that media providers may proﬁt from delivering information that polarizes voters. In conjunction with their analysis, Proposition 7 suggests that this proﬁt-seeking behavior may have detrimental effects on elections.25 23To illustrate, consider the introductory example and suppose that λ = 1/4. Then, if n = 3, the probability that p∗wins in our constructed equilibrium is 27/32, whereas this probability converges to 1 as n →∞. 24In the proof, we show that policy p∗remains optimal at the critical ˆρ. 25Focusing on a different force, Yuksel (2022) showed that segregation in news consumption has a further polarizing effect on the electoral platforms chosen by parties.', '5. EXTENSIONS 5.1. A Characterization for Symmetric Equilibria The analysis of Theorem 1 considers all equilibria, including those that are asymmet- ric.26 Restricting to symmetric equilibria, a stronger form of adverse correlation is nec- essary for the inferior policy to win with scarce information, while a weaker form of ad- vantageous correlation is sufﬁcient to guarantee that the optimal policy wins across all symmetric equilibria. In a symmetric (weakly undominated) equilibrium, informed voters choose their pre- ferred policy and all uninformed voters choose p∗with the same probability α ∈[0\\x031]. When α ∈(0\\x031), a voter can be pivotal when κ others receive good news for any κ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}, because it is always possible for exactly τ −κ uninformed voters to choose p∗along with the κ voters who received good news. However, these events are not equally likely, depending both on the primitive probability of events and the behavior of unin- formed voters. The relevant correlation measure for symmetric equilibria therefore in- volves a weighted sum of the conditional payoffs V G(·) evaluated at different values of κ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}: K(θ) := τ \\x02 κ=0 θκ \\x05 τ κ \\x06 P(G = κ|B = 0)V G(κ)\\x05 This sum again focuses on the perspective of an uninformed voter, whose expected payoff difference conditional on κ others receiving good news and no one receiving bad news is V G(κ). In each summand, P(G = κ|B = 0) is the primitive probability that κ voters receive good news, conditional on no one receiving bad news. The binomial coefﬁcient is an adjustment factor to account for the number of ways that the uninformed voter can be pivotal when no one receives bad news.27 As we elaborate below, the variable θ encodes the relative likelihood that, in a symmetric mixed strategy proﬁle, a vote for policy p∗is cast by an informed rather than an uninformed voter, when κ voters received good news and no one received bad news. In particular, θκ offers additional ﬂexibility in weighting the summands: taking θ →0 concentrates weight on the term that involves V G(0), whereas θ →∞focuses the sum on the term that involves V G(τ). The relevant correlation measure here is the inﬁmum, K∗:= infθ∈R++ K(θ). DEFINITION 4: The collective choice problem is strongly adversely correlated if K∗< 0 and weakly advantageously correlated if K∗> 0. On one hand, V G(κ) > 0 for all κ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ} is sufﬁcient but not necessary for K∗> 0, and so advantageous correlation implies weak advantageous correlation but not vice versa. On the other hand, V G(κ) < 0 for some κ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ} is necessary but not sufﬁ- cient for K∗< 0, and so strong adverse correlation implies adverse correlation but not vice versa.28 26We note that the equilibria described in Proposition 1, Proposition 2, and Theorem 2 are symmetric. 27Note that \\x03 τ κ \\x04 = \\x03 n τ \\x04−1\\x03 n κ \\x04\\x03 n−κ τ−κ \\x04 , where \\x03 n κ \\x04 is the number of ways of selecting the κ voters that receive good news, \\x03 n−κ τ−κ \\x04 is the number of ways of selecting τ −κ uninformed voters to vote for the optimal policy along with voters who received good news, and their product is normalized by the total number of ways of selecting τ votes for the optimal policy \\x03 n τ \\x04 . 28However, V G(τ) < 0 does imply K∗< 0 because, as θ →∞, the τth summand in K(θ) dominates.', 'Every collective choice problem is either strongly adversely or weakly advantageously correlated except in the knife-edge case where K∗= 0, which is possible only on a measure-0 set of parameters. Parallel to Theorem 1, the following theorem therefore essentially characterizes when a collective choice problem is fragile to asymmetric infor- mation with a restriction to symmetric equilibria. THEOREM 3: If the collective choice problem is strongly adversely correlated, the inferior policy p∗wins in a symmetric equilibrium with scarce information. By contrast, if the collec- tive choice problem is weakly advantageously correlated, then the optimal policy p∗wins in every symmetric equilibrium with scarce information. Hence, fragility also emerges with symmetric equilibria. However, establishing this fragility requires a different argument. Suppose that the collective choice problem is strongly adversely correlated; moreover, assume that V G(τ) > 0.29 We show that a se- quence of symmetric mixed strategy equilibria selects policy p∗with probability approach- ing 1 as λ →0. The idea is that K∗< 0 implies the existence of ˜θ such that K( ˜θ) = 0. For each λ ∈(0\\x031), we then choose α such that ˜θ = λ (1−λ)α; in other words, ˜θ is the relative likelihood that a vote for p∗is cast by an informed voter. Choosing α at this rate guar- antees that an uninformed voter is indifferent between policies p∗and p∗conditional on being pivotal, which rationalizes her mixing. Moreover, as λ →0, the probability that an uninformed voter votes for p∗converges to 0. As most voters are uninformed, policy p∗ then wins with near certainty. The converse also requires a different argument because weak advantageous correla- tion does not imply advantageous correlation. However, weak advantageous correlation is sufﬁcient to ensure that, regardless of how one pools votes for p∗from uninformed vot- ers and those who hear good news, uninformed voters are never swayed to vote for policy p∗with substantial probability in any symmetric equilibrium. 5.2. Population Uncertainty The characterization for symmetric equilibria can also accommodate population uncer- tainty. Suppose that, as in Myerson (1998), the population size is random. For simplicity, we assume that the population size is always odd and a policy p ∈{p∗\\x03p∗} is then chosen by simple majority rule: for a realized population of n voters, policy p wins if it receives at least τ(n) + 1 votes, where τ(n) := n−1 2 . We make the following assumption about the random population size. ASSUMPTION 4: The population size N is drawn from a probability measure Q with a ﬁnite expectation and support Q, which is a subset of the odd positive integers strictly greater than 1. Let \\x07n = Vn × Sn be the state space for a realized population size n. Uncertainty is described by the random population size (Q\\x03Q) and a stochastic process {(\\x07n\\x03Pn) : n ∈ Q}, where Pn is a probability distribution over payoff and signals proﬁles, ω ∈\\x07n, for the voters in an election for population size n. We adapt our main assumptions in Section 2 to apply conditional on each population size n (see the Supplemental Appendix for a formal description). In addition, we assume that for every population size n, the ex ante optimal policy p∗is also optimal conditioning on only the population size n. 29If V G(τ) < 0, the equilibrium constructed in the proof of Theorem 1 is already symmetric.', 'We generalize the correlation measure considered in Section 5.1, considering infer- ences that a voter draws were she to think that the population size is n0, which is the smallest population size in Q. Adapting our previous notation, let V G(κ\\x03n0) := V d i (Si = s0\\x03G = κ\\x03B = 0\\x03N = n0) denote the expected payoff difference for a voter who receives the uninformative signal, conditioning on κ voters obtaining good news, no voter obtain- ing bad news, and there being n0 voters (where n0 ≥κ). This term feeds into the relevant correlation measure: K∗(n0) := inf θ∈R++ τ(n0) \\x02 κ=0 θκ \\x05 τ(n0) κ \\x06 P(G = κ|B = 0)V G(κ\\x03n0)\\x05 THEOREM 4: If K∗(n0) < 0, the inferior policy p∗wins in a symmetric equilibrium with scarce information. By contrast, if K∗(n0) > 0, the optimal policy p∗wins in every symmetric equilibrium with scarce information. The key idea is that an uninformed voter believes she is most likely to be pivotal in a small election, and increasingly so as information becomes scarce. Hence, although she may expect that the population is large, her beliefs about adverse correlation at popula- tion size n0 drive behavior. 5.3. The Role of Elites Our baseline model isolates the role of asymmetric information by assuming away all other differences between voters. However, many policy debates that feature zero-sum thinking also involve voters who are ex ante heterogeneous. In this section, we show that heterogeneity makes the election more ripe for zero-sum thinking. We continue to assume that for each voter, p∗is ex ante optimal. We weaken Assump- tion 1 to a “within-group exchangeability” notion: we decompose voters into “elites” and “non-elites” and assume that voters are exchangeable within each group but not necessar- ily across groups. The collective choice problem therefore consists of the set of elite voters E, non-elite voters NE, and a probability space (\\x07\\x03P) = (Vn × Sn\\x03P) such that Assump- tions 2 and 3 are satisﬁed, and for any permutations, ψE : E →E and ψN : NE →NE, and state ω, P(ωE\\x03ωN E) = P(ωψE(E)\\x03ωψN (N E)). Given a non-empty set of voters H, let GH denote the random variable describing the number of voters in H who received good news. DEFINITION 5: The collective choice problem is elite-adversely correlated if there exists a binary partition of the electorate, {E\\x03NE} such that the following hold: (a) Elites are a minority: |E|< τ. (b) Elites do not fear the support of others: V d i \\x03 Si = s0\\x03B = 0\\x03G = GN E = τ −|E| + 1 \\x04 > 0 for every i ∈E\\x05 (c) Non-elites fear the support of others: V d i \\x03 Si = s0\\x03B = 0\\x03G = GN E = τ −|E| \\x04 < 0 for every i ∈NE\\x05 Deﬁnition 5(a) asserts that the elites are a minority of the electorate. Part (b) states that these voters continue to support the optimal policy even after conditioning on the', 'support of others. In other words, they are not concerned about adverse selection. Part (c) states that non-elites, by contrast, are concerned by adverse selection: knowing that all elites vote for the optimal policy, each views her odds of gaining from p∗to be low when sufﬁciently many non-elite voters obtain good news. Parts (b) and (c) together imply that elites are more likely to beneﬁt from policy p∗. A special case of Deﬁnition 5 is where each elite voter has a higher “rank” than every non-elite voter in that an elite voter is guaranteed to gain from the optimal policy p∗ whenever a non-elite voter does. An elite voter then is elated to learn that any non-elite voter has good news for it assures that she, too, gains from p∗. By contrast, non-elites are crowded out from being winners both by elites and other non-elites. In this vein, Deﬁnition 5 views the optimal policy as a gamble that is simply more likely to beneﬁt elites before its rewards trickle down to non-elite voters. As voters agree that p∗is ex ante optimal, it remains the winner with scarce public information. But collective choice is still fragile to private information. PROPOSITION 8: If payoffs are elite-adversely correlated, the inferior policy p∗wins in a strict equilibrium with scarce information. The idea is that elite voters, unconcerned by adverse selection, vote for p∗even when they are uninformed. As elites are a minority, p∗can only be in the race if it has sufﬁ- cient support from non-elites. An uninformed non-elite voter then worries about being crowded out and hence has a strict incentive to vote for p∗. Moreover, the presence of elite voters can exacerbate adverse selection for non-elites. To see how, we specialize to the binary payoff setup described in Section 4.1, in which informed voters obtain perfect news, and assume that Wi ⊆Wj for all i ∈NE and j ∈E, so that an elite voter is assured to gain from p∗if a non-elite voter does. The collective choice problem is then fully described by the probability that a voter receives an informative signal λ, the ex ante distribution over the number of winners PW , the payoffs v = (vW \\x03vL), and the number of elite voters e :=|E|. Let ˜E(e) := {ω ∈\\x07 : Si = s0\\x03B = 0\\x03G = GN E = τ −e}. PROPOSITION 9: For a non-elite voter i, the conditional expected payoff V d i ( ˜E(e)|PW \\x03v\\x03e) is strictly decreasing in the number of elites e. Hence, increasing the size of the elite group expands the range of polarization ratios for which the collective choice problem is majority-adversely correlated, leading to a greater scope for political failures. 6. ZERO-SUM THINKING IN PRACTICE Here, we view some recent political episodes through the lens of our model. Consider, ﬁrst, the public debate on whether the U.S. government should bail out ﬁ- nancial institutions following the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. The Bush administration and other government ofﬁcials emphasized that a bailout was necessary: Ben Bernanke, the then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, argued in a Senate hearing on 24th September 2008 that “I believe if the credit markets are not functioning, that jobs will be lost, the unemployment rate will rise, more houses will be foreclosed upon, GDP will contract, that the economy will just not be able to recover in a normal, healthy way, no matter what other policies are taken.”', 'Nevertheless, the bill proposing the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) did not pass in the U.S. House of Representatives in an initial vote on 29th September. Congressional leaders were inﬂuenced by the large-scale protests against the perceived zero-sum transfer from Main Street to Wall Street, a popular sentiment that was echoed by Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama’s refrain that “taxpayers shouldn’t be spending a dime to reward CEOs on Wall Street while they’re going out the door.” The EESA passed a second vote on October 3rd only after one of the biggest one-day market collapses in U.S. history sent a visible signal of the severe macroeconomic risks from a failure to stabilize the ﬁnancial system. While it was clear that the ﬁnancial industry would proﬁt from the proposed $700 bil- lion bailout, there was considerable aggregate and distributional uncertainty about the broader general equilibrium effects of the deteriorating credit market conditions. Would a bailout be solely distributional, transferring wealth from taxpayers to CEOs, or would there be signiﬁcant beneﬁcial aggregate effects of bailing out ﬁnancial institutions? In- formation on this score was scarce given the sheer complexity of predicting the effects of approving or rejecting the bill, and much of the information in the public sphere empha- sized distributional considerations. In line with Propositions 7 and 8, our analysis suggests that the political debate was ripe for the kind of zero-sum thinking that initially doomed the EESA bill to fail. Our analysis also speaks to why, following the subsequent market crash, the EESA bill passed on its second vote; that crash produced clear information about the aggregate beneﬁts of stabilizing the ﬁnancial system, rendering the collective choice problem more advantageously correlated during the second vote.30 Another important case is the Brexit referendum of 2016. As discussed in the Intro- duction, most estimates both before and after Brexit have indicated that being part of the EU beneﬁts the UK economy, both workers and consumers. However, during the refer- endum, many details of the “Leave” policy were left unspeciﬁed, making its aggregate and distributional ramiﬁcations uncertain. Nevertheless, most accounts of Brexit paint its support as coming from a distrust of the London elite and the EU as well as the increased pressure on public services that came from waves of immigration; see, for example, Osuna et al. (2019). In this setting, information was scarce and the debate largely focused on dis- tributional considerations, both in terms of the contrast between elites and non-elites as well as the “zero-sum game” in public services that could be allocated to “natives” versus “foreigners.” More broadly, we view elements of our analysis to offer a plausible account for how economic anxiety fuels the demand for populist policies. In their survey, Guriev and Pa- paioannou (2022) noted several instances and suggested that “identifying the exact mech- anisms is still an open question.”31 Our analysis offers an informational mechanism: sup- pose that voters do not know if losers will be compensated following greater trade or 30Necessarily, our analysis abstracts from many factors, some of which increase the scope for zero-sum think- ing. We draw attention to how some actors who were privy to the details of the EESA were closely connected to the ﬁnancial industry. Mian, Suﬁ, and Trebbi (2010) also documented that politicians supporting the EESA appear responsive to their constituents as well as to lobbying efforts and contributions from the ﬁnancial in- dustry. Allowing for those who gain from a policy to obtain better information would make a less informed voter even more distrustful than in our model. 31A notable example in the U.S. context is the economic and political response to the China shock, which resulted in a signiﬁcant drop in manufacturing employment and wages (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2016)); Autor, Dorn, Hanson, and Majlesi (2020) documented how this shock has contributed to political polarization and much stronger support for politicians who run on protectionist platforms. Outside the United States, Dal Bó, Finan, Folke, Persson, and Rickne (2023) noted how support for the populist radical-right Sweden- Democrats came from marginalized voters who were far more vulnerable to losing their jobs to immigrants.', 'immigration liberalization, and look to the past to form these beliefs. Were there signif- icant transfers in the past, then voters might see their interests as aligned; however, the absence of past transfers might lead them to worry more about the crowding-out effect, in line with Proposition 3. Moreover, in line with Proposition 8, voters that are more vul- nerable to trade and immigration have more reason to anticipate being crowded out and may therefore be more inclined toward protectionist and populist policies. 7. CONCLUSION Our work describes a strategic mechanism for zero-sum thinking in elections, even if the policy choice is not zero sum. We ﬁnd that voters may choose policies that do not match their collective preferences and information, and that equilibria may be fragile to asymmetric information. The central logic resembles Akerlof’s Lemons Problem: a voter votes against policies supported by others because she is suspicious of what their support means for her. This line of thinking resonates with political rhetoric, particularly in the context of populist movements that suggest that the interests of the elites are fundamentally misaligned with those of the common voter. Although we model the equilibrium logic as applying at an individual level, one could have done so at a group level, in the spirit of ethical voter models (Coate and Conlin (2004), Feddersen and Sandroni (2006)).32 We also see this logic as potentially manifesting in other political contexts, such as legislative action and lobbying, where the interested parties do not expect all to gain but have to act jointly to select a policy. Each player may then worry about being crowded out from gains when she conditions on others supporting a policy. While our analysis tackles several important questions, it leaves others unanswered. We abstract from costly turnout decisions and it may be useful to see how endogenous participation affects collective choice. Equally, it would be interesting to see how parties strategically choose policies to exploit polarization.33 One may also envision the design of information structures to capitalize on zero-sum thinking. We hope to address these questions in future work. APPENDIX The appendix has the following structure: • Appendix A.1 includes preliminary results and notation, describes the decomposition detailed in Section 2.2, and contains all proofs for Section 2. • Appendix A.2 contains all proofs for Section 3. The Supplemental Appendix contains all proofs for Sections 4 and 5. A.1. Preliminaries We ﬁrst provide a formal description of the voting game and establish equilibrium ex- istence, and then describe how we analyze equilibria with scarce information. 32Ethical voter models typically address costly voting; we consider the same calculus here but with costless voting. Say each voter of our model is a stand-in for workers in a different sector, and members of each group vote in the group’s interest. Identical results then ensue if the collective choice problem is adversely correlated across these sectors. 33This has been a theme of recent work, for example, Buisseret and Van Weelden (2022), De Mesquita Ethan and Dziuda (2023), and Levy and Razin (2024).', 'Throughout, C = (N \\x03\\x07\\x03P) refers to a collective choice problem, G = {sk ∈M : V d i (Si = sk) > 0} is the set of signals that convey good news, and B = M \\\\ G the set of signals that convey bad news. For g ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n −1} and m ∈{g\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n −1}, Z(g\\x03m) := P(G = g|M = m)V d i \\x03 G = g\\x03M = m\\x03Si = s0\\x04 is the expected payoff difference for an uninformed voter who learns that m other voters received news g of whom received good news, weighted by the probability that g voters receive good news when m receive news. Finally, s0 is the signal proﬁle where all voters receive the uninformative signal. A.1.1. Strategies and Equilibrium Private Information. A strategy-proﬁle is a mapping σ : N × S →[0\\x031], where σ(i\\x03si) := σi(si) represents the probability that voter i ∈N votes for p∗when she receives the signal si ∈S. Let \\x10 be the set of all strategy-proﬁles, and let \\x10∗ i = \\x07 σ ∈\\x10 : ∀i ∈N \\x03σi \\x03 sk\\x04 = 1 ∀sk ∈G and σi \\x03 sk\\x04 = 0 ∀sk ∈B \\x08 \\x05 The set \\x10∗differs from \\x10 only by excluding strategy-proﬁles where informed voters vote against their own signals, which are weakly dominated strategy-proﬁles by Assumption 2. 34 For a strategy-proﬁle σ ∈\\x10∗, we simplify notation by letting σi := σi(s0). An action-proﬁle is a mapping a : N →{0\\x031}, where a(i) = 1 represents a vote for p∗ and a(i) = 0 represents a vote for p∗. Let A be the set of all action-proﬁles. For a ∈A, a−1(1) := {i ∈N : a(i) = 1} is the set of voters who vote for p∗. For any voter i ∈N and a ∈A, let a−1 −i (1) := a−1(1) −{i}. Given a collective choice problem C = (N \\x03\\x07\\x03P), we denote by Pσ the probability dis- tribution on A × \\x07 induced by strategy-proﬁle σ ∈\\x10 and the primitive distribution P on \\x07, deﬁned by Pσ(a\\x03ω) := P(ω) i∈a−1(1) σi \\x03 Si(ω) \\x04 j∈a−1(0) \\x03 1 −σj \\x03 Sj(ω) \\x04\\x04 \\x05 For a voter i, we then denote by \\x11i(C\\x03σ) the difference between the expected payoff when voter i votes for p∗and the expected payoff when she votes for p∗conditional on her receiving the uninformative signal s0, which equates to \\x11i(C\\x03σ) := \\x02 {ω∈\\x07:P(ω)>0} V d i (ω)Pσ \\x03 a−1 −i (1) = τ|ω \\x04 P \\x03 ω|Si = s0\\x04 since voter i impacts the election outcome only for action-proﬁles with |a−1 −i (1)|= τ. Let Ni(g\\x03m) be the collection of all (N0\\x03N1) such that N0\\x03N1 ⊆N −{i} with N0 ∩N1 = ∅, |N0|= τ −(m −g), and |N1|= τ −g. Then, when σ ∈\\x10∗, \\x11i(C\\x03σ) = τ \\x02 g=0 τ+g \\x02 m=g pi(σ|g\\x03m)P(M = m|Si = s0)Z(g\\x03m)\\x03 34A strategy-proﬁle σ ∈\\x10 is weakly undominated if, for each voter i ∈N , there does not exist an alternative strategy σ′ i such that voter i’s expected payoff from (σ′ i\\x03σ′ −i) is greater than or equal to her expected payoff from (σi\\x03σ′ −i) for all σ′ −i ∈\\x10−i and strictly greater for some σ′ −i ∈\\x10−i.', 'where35 pi(σ|g\\x03m) := Pσ \\x03 a−1 −i (1) = τ|G = g\\x03M = m\\x03Si = s0\\x04 = \\x05 n −1 m \\x06−1 \\x02 (N0\\x03N1)∈Ni(g\\x03m) j∈N1 σj \\x03 s0\\x04 k∈N0 \\x03 1 −σk \\x03 s0\\x04\\x04 \\x05 (1) We observe that a strategy-proﬁle σ ∈\\x10 is an equilibrium (in weakly undominated strategies) if and only if σ ∈\\x10∗and, for all i ∈N , \\x11i(C\\x03σ) > 0 implies σi(s0) = 1 and \\x11i(C\\x03σ) < 0 implies σi(s0) = 0. Public Information. In the public information benchmark, a strategy-proﬁle is a map- ping φ : N × Sn →[0\\x031], where φ(i\\x03s) := φi(s) is the probability that voter i votes for p∗ when she observes the signal-proﬁle s ∈Sn. A.1.2. Proof of Proposition 1 In the private information baseline, let σα ∈\\x10∗denote the symmetric strategy-proﬁle where σα i = α ∈[0\\x031] for all i ∈N . Then, for g ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ} and m ∈{g\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03g + τ}, pi \\x03 σα|g\\x03m \\x04 = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎩ 1[g = τ] if α = 0\\x03 1[m −g = τ] if α = 1\\x03 \\x0f n −1 −m τ −g \\x10 ατ−g(1 −α)τ−(m−g) if α ∈(0\\x031)\\x05 Hence, pi(σα|g\\x03m) is continuous in α, and so \\x11i(C\\x03σα) is continuous in α. If \\x11i(C\\x03σ1) ≥ 0, then σ1 is an equilibrium; if \\x11i(C\\x03σ0) ≤0, then σ0 is an equilibrium; otherwise, there exists α∗∈(0\\x031) such that \\x11i(C\\x03σα∗) = 0 and so σα∗is an equilibrium. In the public information benchmark, the only weakly undominated strategy-proﬁle is φ∗, where φ∗ i (s) := 1[V d i (s) > 0] for all i ∈N , which is the unique equilibrium. A.1.3. Scarce Information For our equilibrium analysis with scarce information, the following lemma shows how the probability distribution P in a collective choice problem can be decomposed into the pair (PI\\x03λ). Given a signal proﬁle s ∈Sn, let I(s) :={i ∈N : si ∈M} be the set of voters who receive an informative signal, and C(s) :={s′ ∈Mn : s′ i = si ∀i ∈I(s)}. LEMMA 1: Let C = (N \\x03\\x07\\x03P) satisfy Assumptions 1 and 2. Then, for any state ω = (v\\x03s) ∈\\x07, P(ω) = λM(s)(1 −λ)n−M(s) \\x02 s′∈C(s) PI \\x03 v\\x03s′\\x04 \\x05 Moreover, if σ ∈\\x10∗, then in each term of \\x11i(C\\x03σ), P(M = m|Si = s0) depends only on λ, pi(σ|g\\x03m) depends only on σ, and Z(g\\x03m) depends only on PI. 35We follow the standard convention that the product over terms in the empty set is 1.', 'PROOF: Given a signal proﬁle s ∈Sn, let sI = {(v\\x03s′) ∈\\x07 : s′ i = si ∀i ∈I(s)} and s−I = {(v\\x03s′) ∈\\x07 : si = s0 ∀i /∈I(s)}. A state (v\\x03s) = {V = v} ∩sI ∩s−I and so, following our notation conventions, P(v\\x03sI\\x03s−I) = P(v\\x03s). Let ω = (v\\x03s) ∈\\x07 with m =|I(s)|. Then, by Assumptions 1 and 2, P(v\\x03s) = P(v\\x03sI\\x03s−I) = P(v\\x03sI)(1 −λ)n−m = P \\x03 v\\x03sI\\x03S ∈Mn\\x04 λn−m (1 −λ)n−m = P \\x03 v\\x03sI|S ∈Mn\\x04 λn λn−m (1 −λ)n−m = λm(1 −λ)n−m \\x02 s′∈C(s) PI \\x03 v\\x03s′\\x04 \\x05 Moreover, by Assumptions 1 and 2, P \\x03 M = m|Si = s0\\x04 = \\x05 n −1 m \\x06 λm(1 −λ)n−1−m\\x03 which depends only on λ. From Equation (1), it is immediate that pi(σ|g\\x03m) depends only on σ when g ≤τ and m ≤τ + g, and pi(σ|g\\x03m) = 0 otherwise. Finally, we show that Z(g\\x03m) depends only on PI. For g ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n−1} and m ∈{g\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n−1}, let \\x07(g\\x03m) := {(v\\x03s) ∈\\x07 : G(s) = g\\x03M(s) = m} and \\x07i(g\\x03m) :={ω ∈\\x07(g\\x03m) : Si = s0}. Then, P \\x03 G = g|M = m\\x03Si = s0\\x04 = \\x02 (v\\x03s)∈\\x07(g\\x03m) λm(1 −λ)n−m \\x02 s′∈C(s) PI \\x03 v\\x03s′\\x04 \\x05 n −1 m \\x06 λm(1 −λ)n−m \\x03 which depends only on PI, and so V d i \\x03 G = g\\x03M = m\\x03Si = s0\\x04 = \\x02 (v\\x03s)∈\\x07i(g\\x03m) P(v\\x03s|G = g\\x03M = m)vd i = \\x02 (v\\x03s)∈\\x07i(g\\x03m) P(v\\x03s) P \\x03 G = g\\x03M = m\\x03Si = s0\\x04vd i = \\x02 (v\\x03s)∈\\x07i(g\\x03m) λm(1 −λ)n−m \\x02 s′∈C(s) PI \\x03 v\\x03s′\\x04 P \\x03 G = g|M = m\\x03Si = s0\\x04\\x05 n −1 m \\x06 λm(1 −λ)n−m vd i depends only on PI. Q.E.D. A.1.4. Proof of Proposition 2 Fix ε ∈(0\\x031) and let λε = 1 −(1 −ε) 1 n . Now consider the equilibrium strategy proﬁle φ∗from the proof of Proposition 1. Since V d i (s0) > 0, σ∗ i (s0) = 1 for all i ∈N , and so p∗ wins in this event. Hence, for all λ ∈(0\\x03λε), the probability that p∗wins is greater than P(S = s0) = (1 −λ)n > (1 −λε)n = (1 −ε).', 'A.2. Proofs for Section 3 In Section 3, we ﬁx (N \\x03\\x07I\\x03PI), and look at the equilibrium outcomes of the family of collective choice problems {(N \\x03\\x07\\x03PI\\x03λ) : λ ∈(0\\x031)} as λ gets small. By Lemma 1, the correlation structure is a property of PI: if any collective choice problem in {(N \\x03\\x07\\x03PI\\x03λ) : λ ∈(0\\x031)} is adversely/advantageously correlated, then all collective choice problems in the class have the same correlation. Since PI is ﬁxed, we write the expected payoff difference \\x11i(C\\x03σ) simply as a function of λ and σ. For κ ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}, Assumption 3 implies that P(G = κ|M = κ\\x03Si = s0) > 0 and V G(κ) ̸= 0; hence, Z(κ\\x03κ) ̸= 0 and, moreover, Z(κ\\x03κ) > 0 if and only if V G(κ) > 0. A.2.1. Proof of Theorem 1 Suppose the collective choice problem is adversely correlated: V G(κ) < 0 for some κ ∈ {1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}. For any t ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n}, let σt be the strategy-proﬁle in \\x10∗where σt i = 1[i ≤t] for all i ∈N (i.e., the ﬁrst t voters vote for p∗when uninformed and the remaining voters vote for p∗when uninformed). Let Nt ={1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03t} and N c t ={t + 1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n}. Now ﬁx ε ∈(0\\x031) and let λε = 1 −(1 −ε) 1 n . If t ≤τ, p∗wins in the event {S = s0} and so, for all λ ∈(0\\x03λε), the probability that p∗wins is greater than (1 −ε). We can therefore complete the proof by showing that there exists ¯λ such that, for all λ < ¯λ, σt is an equilibrium for some t ≤τ. We do this by considering the two cases where V G(τ) < 0 and V G(τ) > 0. Case 1: When V G(τ) < 0, σ0 is an equilibrium for λ sufﬁciently small. For any voter i ∈N , pi(σ0|g\\x03m) = 1[g = τ] because only voters with good signals vote for p∗. Hence, \\x11i \\x03 λ\\x03σ0\\x04 = τ+g \\x02 m=τ \\x05 n −1 m \\x06 λm(1 −λ)n−1−mZ(g\\x03m)\\x05 Since λτ(1 −λ)τ > 0, it follows that \\x11i(λ\\x03σ0) < 0 if and only if τ+g \\x02 m=τ \\x05 n −1 m \\x06\\x05 λ 1 −λ \\x06m−τ Z(g\\x03m) < 0\\x03 where the LHS converges to \\x03 n−1 τ \\x04 Z(τ\\x03τ) < 0 as λ →0. Case 2: When V G(τ) > 0, there exists κ ∈{1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ −1} such that V G(κ) < 0 and V G(κ′) > 0 for κ′ ∈{κ + 1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}, and στ−κ is an equilibrium for λ sufﬁciently small. For any voter i ∈Nτ−κ, pi(στ−κ|g\\x03m) = 0 if g < τ −(τ −κ −1) = κ + 1 because there are only τ −κ −1 other voters who vote for p∗when uninformed. Hence, \\x11i \\x03 λ\\x03στ−κ\\x04 = τ \\x02 g=κ+1 τ+g \\x02 m=g \\x05 n −1 m \\x06 λm(1 −λ)n−1−mpi \\x03 στ−κ|g\\x03m \\x04 Z(g\\x03m)\\x05 Since λκ+1(1 −λ)n−1−(κ+1) > 0, it follows that \\x11i(λ\\x03στ−κ) > 0 if and only if τ \\x02 g=κ+1 τ+g \\x02 m=g \\x05 n −1 m \\x06\\x05 λ 1 −λ \\x06m−(κ+1) pi \\x03 στ−κ|g\\x03m \\x04 Z(g\\x03m) > 0\\x03', 'where the LHS converges to \\x03 n−1 κ+1 \\x04 pi(στ−κ|κ + 1\\x03κ + 1)Z(κ + 1\\x03κ + 1) as λ →0. Since i is pivotal in the non-null event where all κ + 1 of the voters in N c τ−κ receive good news, pi(στ−κ|κ + 1\\x03κ + 1) > 0, and Z(κ + 1\\x03κ + 1) > 0 because V G(κ + 1) > 0. Hence, \\x11i(λ\\x03στ−κ) > 0 for λ sufﬁciently small. For any voter i ∈N c τ−κ, pi(στ−κ|g\\x03m) = 0 if g < τ −(τ −κ) = κ because there are τ −κ other voters who vote for p∗when uninformed. Hence, \\x11i \\x03 λ\\x03στ−κ\\x04 = τ \\x02 g=κ τ+g \\x02 m=g \\x05 n −1 m \\x06 λm(1 −λ)n−1−mpi \\x03 στ−κ|g\\x03m \\x04 Z(g\\x03m)\\x05 Since λκ(1 −λ)n−1−(κ) > 0, it follows that \\x11i(λ\\x03στ−κ) < 0 if and only if τ \\x02 g=κ τ+g \\x02 m=g \\x05 n −1 m \\x06\\x05 λ 1 −λ \\x06m−κ pi \\x03 στ−κ|g\\x03m \\x04 Z(g\\x03m) < 0\\x03 where the LHS converges to pi(στ−κ|κ\\x03κ)Z(κ\\x03κ) as λ →0. Since i is pivotal in the non- null event where κ voters in N c τ−κ receive good news, pi(στ−κ|κ\\x03κ) > 0, and Z(κ\\x03κ) < 0 because V G(κ) < 0. Hence, \\x11i(λ\\x03στ−κ) < 0 for λ sufﬁciently small. Together, the two cases show that, with adverse correlation, there exists some ¯λ ∈(0\\x031) such that, for all λ ∈(0\\x03 ¯λ), there is an equilibrium in which a majority of voters vote for p∗when they are uninformed. Hence, p∗wins when all voters are uninformed and so, for λ ≤min{¯λ\\x03λε}, there is an equilibrium in which p∗wins with probability exceeding 1 −ε. For the converse, suppose the informed collective choice problem is advantageously correlated: V G(κ) > 0 for all κ ∈{1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}. Fix some ε ∈(0\\x031), let σ ∈\\x10∗, and, without loss of generality, let σi ≥σi+1 for i = 1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n −1. We show that, for the strategy-proﬁle σ and λ sufﬁciently small, either p∗wins with probability exceeding 1 −ε or σ is not an equilibrium. Let δ := (1 −ε) 1 2(τ+1) ∈(0\\x031) and λ′ ε = 1 −(1 −ε) 1 2n . If στ+1 ≥δ, then, in the event {S = s0} where all voters are uninformed, voters i = 1\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ + 1 vote for p∗with probability at least δ. Therefore, for all λ ∈(0\\x03λ′ ε), Pσ \\x03 a−1(1) ≥τ + 1 \\x04 ≥δτ+1(1 −λ)n > (1 −ε) τ+1 2(τ+1) (1 −ε) n 2n = 1 −ε\\x05 To complete the proof, it sufﬁces to show that, if στ+1 < δ, then there exists λε such that, for all λ ∈(0\\x03λε), σ is not an equilibrium. Therefore, suppose στ+1 < δ. We consider voter n, who, when uninformed, votes p∗ with probability less than 1, and show that this is not a best-response. For g ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ} and m ∈{g\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ + g}, it follows from Equation (1) that \\x05 n −1 m \\x06−1 (1 −δ)τ−(m−g) τ−g j=1 σj ≤pn(σ|g\\x03m) ≤ \\x05 n −1 −m τ −g \\x06 τ−g j=1 σj\\x03 and, therefore, for g ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}, τ+g \\x02 m=g pn(σ|g\\x03m)P \\x03 M = m|Sn = s0\\x04 Z(g\\x03m)', '≥λg(1 −λ)n−1−g τ−g j=1 σj \\x0f (1 −δ)τZ(g\\x03g) − τ+g \\x02 m=g+1 \\x05 λ 1 −λ \\x06m−g M(m\\x03g) Z(g\\x03m) \\x10 \\x03 where M(m\\x03g) is shorthand for the multinomial coefﬁcient M(m\\x03g) := \\x05 n −1 m\\x03τ −g\\x03τ −(m −g) \\x06 \\x05 Since δ ∈(0\\x031) and Z(g\\x03g) > 0, there exists λg ∈(0\\x031) such that (1 −δ)τZ(g\\x03g) − τ+g \\x02 m=g+1 \\x05 λ 1 −λ \\x06m−g M(m\\x03g) Z(g\\x03m) > 0 for all λ ∈(0\\x03λg). In particular, λg depends only on CI. Let λε = min{λg : g ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}}. Since \\x11τ−g j=1 σj > 0 when g = τ, it follows that \\x11n(λ\\x03σ) > 0 for all λ ∈(0\\x03λε). But then σ is not an equilibrium for λ ∈(0\\x03λε) because σn < 1. A.2.2. Proof of Theorem 2 We ﬁrst observe that, for σ ∈\\x10∗, \\x11i(λ\\x03σ) can equivalently be written in terms of the number of other voters who receive bad news: \\x11i(λ\\x03σ) = τ \\x02 b=0 τ+b \\x02 m=b qi(σ|b\\x03m) \\x05 n −1 m \\x06 λm(1 −λ)n−1−mZB(b\\x03m)\\x03 where, for b ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ} and m ∈{b\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ + b}, qi(σ|b\\x03m) = pi(σ|m −b\\x03m) and ZB(b\\x03m) = Z(m −b\\x03m). Now ﬁx ε ∈(0\\x031) and let σα ∈\\x10∗be the symmetric strategy-proﬁle from the proof of Proposition 1, where σi := α ∈[0\\x031] for all i ∈N . We consider three cases. Case 1: If ZB(τ\\x03τ) > 0, then there exists λε such that, for all λ ∈(0\\x03λε), σ1 is an equi- librium in which p∗wins with probability exceeding 1 −ε. Let λε = 1 −(1 −ε) 1 n . For the strategy-proﬁle σ1, p∗wins in the event {S = s0} and so, for all λ ∈(0\\x03λε), the probability that p∗wins is greater than (1 −ε). We can therefore complete the proof by showing that \\x11i(λ\\x03σ1) > 0 for λ sufﬁciently small. From Equation (1), qi(σ1|b\\x03m) = 1[τ = b] and so \\x11i \\x03 λ\\x03σ1\\x04 = λτ(1 −λ)τ n−1 \\x02 m=τ \\x05 n −1 m \\x06\\x05 λ 1 −λ \\x06m−τ ZB(b\\x03m)\\x05 Since λτ(1 −λ)τ > 0, it follows that \\x11i(λ\\x03σ1) > 0 if and only if n−1 \\x02 m=τ \\x05 n −1 m \\x06\\x05 λ 1 −λ \\x06m−τ ZB(b\\x03m) > 0\\x03 where the LHS converges to \\x03 n−1 τ \\x04 ZB(τ\\x03τ) > 0 as λ →0.', 'Case 2: If ZB(τ\\x03τ) < 0, there exists λε such that, for all λ ∈(0\\x03λε), there is α ∈(0\\x031) such that σα is an equilibrium in which p∗wins with probability exceeding 1 −ε. Let λε = 1 −(1 −ε) 1 2n = ¯α. Then, for all λ ∈(0\\x03λε) and α ∈(¯α\\x031], the probability that p∗wins for the strategy-proﬁle σα in the event {S = s0} exceeds αn, and so p∗wins with probability exceeding αn(1 −λ)n > ¯αn(1 −λε)n = 1 −ε\\x05 Hence, it sufﬁces to show that there exists ¯λ ∈(0\\x03λε) such that, for all λ ∈(0\\x03 ¯λ), there exists αλ ∈(¯α\\x031) such that σαλ is an equilibrium. Analogous to the argument in Case 1, ZB(τ\\x03τ) < 0 implies that there exists λ1 ∈(0\\x03λε) such that, for all λ ∈(0\\x03λ1), \\x11i(λ\\x03σ1) < 0. Since ¯α ∈(0\\x031), for b ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ} and m ∈{b\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ + b}, qi \\x03 σ ¯α|b\\x03m \\x04 = \\x05 n −1 −m τ −b \\x06 (1 −¯α)τ−b ¯ατ−(m−b) > 0 and, hence, \\x11i \\x03 λ\\x03σ ¯α\\x04 = (1 −λ)n−1 τ \\x02 b=0 τ+b \\x02 m=b \\x05 λ 1 −λ \\x06m \\x05 n −1 m \\x06 qi \\x03 σ ¯α|b\\x03m \\x04 ZB(b\\x03m)\\x03 which converges to \\x03 n−1 τ \\x04 (1 −¯α)τ ¯ατZB(0\\x030) as λ →0. Since ZB(0\\x030) > 0, there exists λ2 ∈(0\\x03λε) such that, for all λ ∈(0\\x03λ2), \\x11i(λ\\x03σ ¯α) > 0. Now let ¯λ = min{λ1\\x03λ2\\x03λε} and let λ ∈(0\\x03 ¯λ). Then, \\x11i(λ\\x03σ1) < 0 < \\x11i(λ\\x03σ ¯α) and, since \\x11i(λ\\x03σα) is continuous in α, there exists αλ ∈(¯α\\x031) such that \\x11i(λ\\x03σαλ) = 0, and so σαλ is an equilibrium in which p∗wins with probability exceeding 1 −ε. Case 3: If ZB(τ\\x03τ) = 0, then P(B = τ|M = m) = 0 for all m ∈{τ\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03n −1}. Since pi(σ1|m −b\\x03m) = 0 for all b ∈{0\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ −1} and m ∈{b\\x03\\x05\\x05\\x05\\x03τ}, it follows that \\x11i(λ\\x03σ1) = 0 for all λ, and so σ1 is an equilibrium in which p∗wins in the event{S = s0}.
