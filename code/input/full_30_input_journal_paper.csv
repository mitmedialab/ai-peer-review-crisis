1,Endogenous Liquidity and Capital Reallocation,"This paper studies economies where firms acquire capital in primary markets and then, after idiosyncratic productivity shocks, retrade it in secondary markets that incorporate bilateral trade with search, bargaining, and liquidity frictions. We distinguish between full or partial sales (one firm gets all or some of the other’s capital) and document several long- and short-run empirical patterns between these variables and the cost of liquidity, as measured by inflation. Quantitatively, the model can match these patterns plus the standard business cycle facts. We also investigate the impact of search frictions, monetary and fiscal policy, persistence in shocks, and returns to scale.

2,The Value of Information in Competitive Markets: Evidence from Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises,"We empirically investigate how the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) changes when gaining access to market information. To do so, we evaluate the impact of an information program diffused by a bank among its SME customers. Adopting firms gained access to reports with rich information about their own clientele and that of nearby establishments. While we find that adoption is associated with a 4.5% revenue increase, our instrumental variable results indicate that adoption increases revenue by 9%. The main mechanism driving our result is that the new information prompted adopting establishments to target gender-age customer groups underserved before adoption.",https://www-journals-uchicago-edu/doi/10.1086/732525,Journal of Political Economy,
3,Mobility for All: Representative Intergenerational Mobility Estimates over the Twentieth Century,"We estimate long-run trends in intergenerational relative mobility for representative samples of the US-born population. Harmonizing all surveys that include father’s occupation and own family income, we develop a mobility measure that allows for the inclusion of nonwhite individuals and women for the 1910s–1970s birth cohorts. We show that mobility increases between the 1910s and 1940s cohorts and that the decline of Black-white income gaps explains about half of this rise. We also find that excluding Black Americans, particularly women, considerably overstates the level of mobility for twentieth-century birth cohorts while simultaneously understating its increase between the 1910s and 1940s.",https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/732527,Journal of Political Economy,
4,Stationary Social Learning in a Changing Environment,"We consider social learning in a changing world. With changing states, societies can be responsive only if agents regularly act upon fresh information, which significantly limits the value of observational learning. When the state is close to persistent, a consensus whereby most agents choose the same action typically emerges. However, the consensus action is not perfectly correlated with the state, because societies exhibit inertia following state changes. When signals are precise enough, learning is incomplete, even if agents draw large samples of past actions, as actions then become too correlated within samples, thereby reducing informativeness and welfare.

5,Ambiguous Contracts,"We explore the deliberate infusion of ambiguity into the design of contracts. We show that when the agent is ambiguity-averse and hence chooses an action that maximizes their minimum utility, the principal can strictly gain from using an ambiguous contract, and this gain can be arbitrarily high. We characterize the structure of optimal ambiguous contracts, showing that ambiguity drives optimal contracts toward simplicity. We also provide a characterization of ambiguity-proof classes of contracts, where the principal cannot gain by infusing ambiguity. Finally, we show that when the agent can engage in mixed actions, the advantages of ambiguous contracts disappear.

6,Propagation and Amplification of Local Productivity Spillovers,"The gains from agglomeration economies are believed to be highly localized. Using confidential Census plant-level data, we show that large industrial plant openings raise the productivity not only of local plants but also of distant plants hundreds of miles away, which belong to large multi-plant, multi-region firms that are exposed to the local productivity spillover through one of their plants. This “global” productivity spillover does not decay with distance and is stronger if plants are in industries that share knowledge with each other. To quantify the significance of firms' plant-level networks for the propagation and amplification of local productivity shocks, we estimate a quantitative spatial model in which plants of multi-region firms are linked through shared knowledge. Counterfactual exercises show that while large industrial plant openings have a greater local impact in less developed regions, the aggregate gains are greatest when the plants locate in well-developed regions, which are connected to other regions through firms' plant-level (knowledge-sharing) networks.

7,Perceptions About Monetary Policy,"We estimate perceptions about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy rule from panel data on professional forecasts of interest rates and macroeconomic conditions. The perceived dependence of the federal funds rate on economic conditions varies substantially over time, in particular over the monetary policy cycle. Forecasters update their perceptions about the Fed’s policy rule in response to monetary policy actions, measured by high-frequency interest rate surprises, suggesting that they have imperfect information about the rule. Monetary policy perceptions matter for monetary transmission, as they affect the sensitivity of interest rates to macroeconomic news, term premia in long-term bonds, and the response of the stock market to monetary policy surprises. A simple learning model with forecaster heterogeneity and incomplete information about the policy rule motivates and explains our empirical findings.

8,Global Firms in Large Devaluations,"I investigate the consequences of firms’ joint import and export decisions in the context of large devaluations. I provide empirical evidence that large devaluations are characterized by an increase in the aggregate share of imported inputs in total input spending and by reallocation of resources toward import-intensive firms, contrary to what standard quantitative trade models predict. These facts are explained by the expansion of exporters, which are intense importers. I develop a model where firms globally decide their import and export strategies and discipline it to match salient features of the Mexican micro data. After a devaluation, the model reproduces the pattern of low aggregate substitution and firm reallocation observed in the data. Compared with a benchmark without global firms, the model predicts higher growth of total exports and imports and a smaller reduction in the trade deficit.

9,Using Divide-and-Conquer to Improve Tax Collection,"Tax collection with limited enforcement capacity may be consistent with both high- and low-delinquency regimes: high delinquency reduces the effectiveness of threats, thereby reinforcing high delinquency. We explore the practical challenges of unraveling the high-delinquency equilibrium using a mechanism design insight known as divide-and-conquer. Our preferred mechanism takes the form of prioritized iterative enforcement (PIE). Taxpayers are ranked using the ratio of expected collection to capacity use. Collection threats are issued in small batches to ensure high credibility and induce high compliance. Following repayments, liberated capacity is used to issue the next round of threats. In collaboration with a district of Lima, we experimentally assess PIE in a sample of 13,432 property taxpayers. The data validate and refine our theoretical framework. A semi-structural model suggests that keeping collection actions fixed, PIE would increase tax revenue by roughly 10%.",https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/139/4/2475/7699856,The Quarterly Journal of Economics,
10,Revealing inequality aversion from tax policy and the role of non-discrimination,"Governments have increasing access to individual information, but they exploit little of it when setting taxes. This paper shows how to reveal inequality aversion from observed tax policy choices of such governments. First, I map governments' priorities into concerns for vertical and horizontal equity. While vertical equity underlies inequality aversion, horizontal equity introduces a restriction against tax discrimination. This restriction affects the measurement of inequality aversion. Second, I apply the model to a hypothetical gender tax using Norwegian tax return data. The main result is that inequality aversion is overestimated when horizontal equity is ignored.

11,Monetary union effects on high inflation episodes,"This paper analyses whether monetary union membership reduces the duration of high inflation episodes (HIEs). The study uses survival models estimated on a sample of 190 countries over the period 1950M01 to 2022M12. The results show that despite the often-cited issue of the heterogeneity of member countries, monetary unions significantly reduce the duration of HIEs, but not deflation episodes. This result remains robust to a battery of tests and is valid for both developed and developing countries. Furthermore, the results show that giving up monetary sovereignty in favour of an independent common central bank is more effective in terms of price stability than adopting inflation targeting. However, for countries seeking to preserve their monetary sovereignty, inflation targeting remains the best option for reducing the duration of HIEs. This performance of monetary unions in terms of price stability appears to be linked to the greater de facto independence of their central banks, the adoption of supranational fiscal rules, and the incentives to preserve the durability of the currency area. However, estimates show that the capacity of a monetary union to limit HIEs among its members diminishes as it expands to include new countries.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecca.12564,Economica,
12,Establishment size and the task content of jobs: evidence from 46 countries,"Using a mix of household- and employer-based survey data from 46 countries, we provide novel evidence that workers in larger establishments perform more non-routine analytical tasks, even within narrowly defined occupations. Moreover, workers in larger establishments rely more on the use of information and communication technologies to perform these tasks. We also document a 15% raw wage premium that workers in larger establishments enjoy relative to their counterparts in smaller establishments. A mediation analysis shows that our novel empirical facts on the task content of jobs are able to explain 5–20% of the establishment size wage premium, a similar fraction to what can be explained by selection of workers on education, gender and age.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecca.12563,Economica,
13,Judicial Reform and Banks Credit Risk Exposure,"The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of the Judicial System Reform, which was introduced in Italy in 2012, on the efficiency of the judicial system and the exposure of banks to credit risk in terms of Non-performing loans. To this end, we apply a difference-in-differences approach, using a dataset that covers annual judicial proceedings from 2010 to 2017, supplemented by bank balance sheet data. Our findings indicate that the reform had a detrimental effect on both judicial efficiency and the NPL ratio. The negative impact is especially pronounced in courts that were previously more efficient, suggesting that the court mergers may have resulted in diseconomies of scale.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obes.12652,Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics,
14,Long-run Effects of Austerity: An Analysis of Size Dependence and Persistence in Fiscal Multipliers,"This paper provides evidence that austerity shocks have long-run negative effects on GDP. Our baseline results show that contractionary fiscal shocks larger than 3% of GDP generate a negative effect of more than 5.5% on GDP even after 15 years. Evidence is also found linking austerity to smaller capital stock and total hours worked in the long-run. The results are robust to different fiscal shock datasets, the exclusion of particular shocks, and the use of cleaner controls. The paper also engages with the emerging discussion regarding fiscal multipliers heterogeneity, presenting evidence that the effects of exogenous fiscal measures are nonlinear on the shock size. The results also contribute to the broader discussion on the long-run effects of demand by suggesting that such shocks might permanently affect the economy.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12646,Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics,
15,Who Gets Vaccinated? Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Predictors of Individual Behaviour in Pandemics,"This study investigates different cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics associated with individuals' willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and their actual vaccination status. Our empirical analysis is based on data obtained from three survey waves conducted in 2021 among about 2,000 individuals living in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. We find that individuals with a high level of trait reactance – a personality characteristic that entails the personal tendency to perceive persuasion attempts as restricting one's freedom – display a significantly lower willingness to get vaccinated. They also tend to get inoculated later or never. Moreover, neuroticism, locus of control, and statistical numeracy appear to be associated with the willingness to get vaccinated, but these results are less pronounced and less robust. Our results indicate that vaccination campaigns and policies could be improved by specifically addressing those with a high level of trait reactance.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obes.12644,Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics,
16,Firms and economic performance: A view from trade,"We use transaction-level US import data to compare firms from virtually all countries in the world competing in a single destination market. First, we decompose countries’ sales into the contribution of the number of firm-products, their average appeal and its dispersion. Then, by making distributional assumptions consistent with the data, we identify new structural parameters that are useful in understanding the role of firm heterogeneity for trade and economic performance. We find that differences in the dispersion of appeal are quantitatively important in explaining exports, even after controlling for selection, average appeal and other determinants of trade, and that they are relevant for welfare. We also find that countries with a higher GDP per capita export more per firm largely because they have a higher dispersion of appeal, hence more heterogeneous firms.

17,"Time-varying stock return correlation, news shocks, and business cycles","The cross-sectional average of the pairwise correlations between U.S. stock returns is considered as a measure of risk to aggregate wealth priced by the stock market. We show that this measure predicts future U.S. output growth at a horizon of one to four years. A stronger average correlation of stock returns foreshadows significantly lower future output growth, even when controlling for some other widely used financial predictors. An innovation to average correlation gives rise to macroeconomic dynamics that resemble negative news about future total factor productivity (TFP) in a vector autoregression. TFP news shocks thus appear to be a key source of aggregate risk priced into stocks.

We use census data from 1960 and 1981 to study the impacts of this massive influx of workers on the existing workforce. We observe gendered effects in natives’ labour market outcomes: male and female natives leave dependent employment. We find robust evidence of females moving to inactivity, and suggestive evidence that males move into self-employment. The effects are driven by the repatriates who are Portuguese-born. The identification strategy exploits the repatriates’ municipality of birth and a large-scale resettlement program relying on hotel capacity.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001429212400254X,European Economic Review,
19,Accounting Conservatism in the Perspective of Positive Accounting Theory: A Study of Islamic Banking in Indonesia,"Conservative accounting in Islamic banking is a crucial issue. This research aims to analyze the influence of executive compensation, the debt covenant, political cost, the composition of the commissioner board, the audit committee, and operating cash flow on the principle of accounting conservatism practiced in Islamic banking in Indonesia. Using data for 13 Islamic banks from 2014 to 2018 and employing panel regression, this study revealed that debt covenant, political cost, and operating cash flow significantly influence accounting conservatism. This result reconfirms the Positive Accounting Theory and Free Cash Flow Theory. However, the other three factors, i.e., executive compensation, the composition of the board of commissioners, and the audit committee were found to have no impact on accounting conservatism. From the findings, the study recommends that policy makers should improve the practice of good corporate governance in Islamic banking, thus the issue of conservative accounting methods could be minimized.",https://archive.aessweb.com/index.php/5002/article/view/4500,Asian Economic and Financial Review (AEFR),

","The present study was carried out to evaluate the performance of selected Islamic banks in Bangladesh. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were used. The relevant data and information were collected from relevant banks and stock exchanges. The performance of the banks was assessed through different variables, such as paid-up capital, investment-to-deposit ratio, classified investments, assets, net income, earnings per share (EPS) and dividends, which were then analyzed using various statistical measures, such as growth percentage, trend equations, the square of the correlation coefficient, and a correlation matrix. Fifty trend equations and R-squared were tested for ten different banks' activities. Among them, the trend values were positive for all the banks. The square of the correlation coefficient (R2) of most of the equations is more than 0.8, indicating well-fitting trend equations.

","This study aims to examine whether risk disclosure practices and corporate governance mechanisms are associated with the performance of listed companies in Malaysia’s emerging economy. The study uses fixed effects panel data regression models to gauge the relationship using 899 firm-year observations from companies that provide risk disclosures in their annual reports. The findings show that risk disclosure has a significant effect on firm performance. Audit committee monitoring also has a significant relationship with firm performance, while the results regarding the existence of a risk management committee are insignificant. In additional analyses, a composite measure of audit committee effectiveness confirms that its monitoring role improves firm performance significantly. This study addresses risk disclosure practices in an under-researched setting (Malaysia) with different corporate governance models and emerging risk reporting legislation, thus adding to the limited body of knowledge on corporate risk disclosure and corporate monitoring and their impact on firm performance.",https://archive.aessweb.com/index.php/5002/article/view/4516,Asian Economic and Financial Review (AEFR),

","Combat stress and decision-making process in dynamic contexts are almost unexplored and still incompletely clear to the scientific community. On the other side, both are some key aspects of combat performance. Operational psychology is focused on using psychological knowledge in enhancing operational performance. First is necessary to understand their nature and relationship, in the direction of making strategies for training and dealing. Stress is productive when is optimal, while decision making process has its specifics in dynamic and risk contexts. Stress has an impact on decision making process, but their relationship is still unclear, as well as whether they can be seen as a related concept or separate phenomena. However, both are based on certain psychological processes, whose understanding and impact can lead to necessary changes in performance as a human behavior, and whose are base for mental readiness training programs. It is recommended to include these programs within the basic military training, to enhance military performance.

Topics like flow shop and parallel machine models are traditionally discussed in an Industrial Engineering class. However, we discussed these topics successfully in a fashion management class by providing examples that our students could relate to. This included examples in apparel production and fashion retailing. The students were also able to learn several logical Excel based formulas while creating spreadsheets for these topics. For the flow shop model, we create a spreadsheet model that reflects all details of the Gantt chart including idle times. In the case of parallel machines, the spreadsheet involves the more complex Nested IF functions. The students showed enthusiasm even when creating the more challenging spreadsheet models.

28,"The Impact of Digitalization on Labor Markets: Evidence from Regional Broadband Penetration
","This paper examines how the expansion of broadband internet access—arguably the backbone of modern digital infrastructure—affects labor market outcomes in advanced economies. Using a unique panel dataset at the regional level across multiple OECD countries between 2005 and 2020, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in broadband rollout stemming from historical differences in local infrastructure and public policy mandates. We find that increases in broadband penetration lead to shifts in local labor markets, primarily via an increase in high-skill occupations and a decline in routine and low-skill employment. We explore different potential mechanisms behind these changes and present evidence that skill-biased technological change and firm-level organizational innovations both play a role. Our findings suggest that while digitalization offers opportunities for productivity growth and upward mobility, it also risks exacerbating earnings inequality across regions and skill categories, underscoring the importance of targeted public policies to foster inclusive economic growth.",NA,GPT-o1,
29,"Monetary Shocks, Labor Market Frictions, and Income Inequality: A Heterogeneous Agents Approach","This paper investigates the relationship between monetary policy shocks, labor market frictions, and income inequality in a heterogeneous agents model. We develop a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) framework in which households differ in skill levels, wealth, and labor force attachment. Our model introduces search-and-matching frictions in the labor market and accommodates incomplete asset markets, thereby capturing the ways in which aggregate shocks have unequal effects on households. We calibrate the model to United States data and estimate that expansionary monetary policy, while boosting average output and employment, magnifies income disparities under certain conditions of labor market stickiness. Targeted transfers and labor market reforms that reduce matching frictions mitigate this adverse distributional effect. Our results suggest that policymakers should consider inequality implications when designing monetary policy, highlighting the importance of coordination between monetary and labor market policies.

30,The Labor Market Effects of a Temporary Universal Basic Income: Evidence from a Randomized Experiment,"This paper examines the short-run labor market effects of a Temporary Universal Basic Income (TUBI) program using data from a large-scale randomized experiment in Country X. We randomly assigned monthly transfers to a representative sample of working-age adults over a period of twelve months. Leveraging experimental variation, we estimate the causal impact of TUBI on labor supply, job search, and overall household wellbeing. Contrary to traditional concerns that such transfers discourage labor market participation, our findings indicate modest effects on labor supply—specifically, a small but statistically significant positive effect on both employment and earnings for some subgroups. Furthermore, TUBI recipients reported substantial improvements in financial security and psychological wellbeing. Our results contribute to the active policy debate surrounding basic income guarantees, suggesting that well-designed transfer programs may reduce material hardship without severely diminishing labor market participation.
