Title:
The Labor Market Effects of a Temporary Universal Basic Income: Evidence from a Randomized Experiment

Abstract

This paper examines the short-run labor market effects of a Temporary Universal Basic Income (TUBI) program using data from a large-scale randomized experiment in Country X. We randomly assigned monthly transfers to a representative sample of working-age adults over a period of twelve months. Leveraging experimental variation, we estimate the causal impact of TUBI on labor supply, job search, and overall household wellbeing. Contrary to traditional concerns that such transfers discourage labor market participation, our findings indicate modest effects on labor supply—specifically, a small but statistically significant positive effect on both employment and earnings for some subgroups. Furthermore, TUBI recipients reported substantial improvements in financial security and psychological wellbeing. Our results contribute to the active policy debate surrounding basic income guarantees, suggesting that well-designed transfer programs may reduce material hardship without severely diminishing labor market participation.

1. Introduction

Universal basic income (UBI) has emerged as a prominent policy proposal in discussions of economic security, poverty alleviation, and the future of work (Banerjee et al., 2019; Hoynes & Rothstein, 2019). Proponents argue that UBI can address gaps in existing social safety nets, reduce poverty traps, and foster productivity by providing a stable economic foundation. Critics counter that unconditional cash transfers could decrease labor supply and increase reliance on government support, undermining both productivity and tax revenues (Moffitt, 2002).

Despite the theoretical appeal and widespread interest, empirical evidence on UBI is sparse, particularly in high-income contexts. Existing studies often rely on small-scale pilots or observational data subject to selection biases, making it difficult to draw causal inferences (Banerjee & Duflo, 2011). This study contributes to the literature by evaluating a carefully implemented Temporary Universal Basic Income (TUBI) experiment in Country X—a middle- to high-income setting with well-established labor regulations and a functioning social safety net.

We utilize a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design in which households in the treatment group received an unconditional monthly cash transfer equivalent to approximately 20% of the median household income for twelve months. We trace short-run labor market outcomes such as employment status, hours worked, earnings, and job search activity. We further explore effects on subjective wellbeing measures, savings, and consumption. Our findings provide valuable insights into how cash transfers affect labor incentives and economic security.

2. Conceptual Framework

2.1. The Income-Leisure Trade-off

Classical labor economics posits that individuals derive utility from both consumption (financed by labor income) and leisure (Becker, 1965). Increasing non-labor income, as with TUBI, could reduce labor supply if the income effect dominates the substitution effect (Blundell & Macurdy, 1999). This framework has often motivated concerns that a guaranteed income might reduce work effort.

2.2. Liquidity Constraints and Behavioral Responses

Conversely, another branch of literature emphasizes how liquidity constraints and financial stress can impede job search, training, or entrepreneurial activities (Banerjee & Duflo, 2014; Farhi & Werning, 2013). Under such constraints, additional cash may facilitate more efficient job matching, human capital investments, or reduce stress-related productivity declines. In this scenario, TUBI could increase labor market participation or wages.

2.3. Household Bargaining Dynamics

Within households, TUBI may shift intrahousehold bargaining power, especially if transfers are assigned to individuals rather than households as a unit (Lundberg & Pollak, 1996). This shift can alter labor supply decisions in gender- or age-stratified ways. For instance, the non-labor income might enable women to either reduce “double shifts” of paid work plus home production or to seek higher-wage employment opportunities (Bertrand et al., 2015).

3. Experimental Design and Data

3.1. Sample Selection

The study is based on a stratified random sample of 5,000 working-age adults (ages 18–65) residing in a diverse set of urban and rural regions in Country X. Stratification ensured proportional representation of demographic characteristics, including gender, household size, and baseline income levels. All participants were enrolled in a baseline survey before randomization.

3.2. Treatment Assignment

Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:
	1.	TUBI Group (Treatment): Received a monthly unconditional cash transfer of 300 Country X dollars (approximately 20% of median household income) for twelve consecutive months.
	2.	Control Group: Received no cash transfers during the study period but continued to have access to existing social programs.

Both groups were surveyed at baseline, midline (six months after the start of the transfers), and endline (twelve months). Attrition rates were below 5%, and no significant differential attrition was detected between the treatment and control groups.

3.3. Outcomes and Variables
	•	Labor Supply: Employment status (binary), weekly hours worked, monthly earnings from employment.
	•	Job Search Behavior: Number of job applications submitted, participation in training or skill enhancement programs.
	•	Financial Outcomes: Total household savings, access to formal credit, expenditure patterns (e.g., durable vs. non-durable consumption).
	•	Subjective Wellbeing: Self-reported financial stress, life satisfaction, mental health indicators.

3.4. Identification Strategy

The randomized assignment allows for a straightforward estimation of the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) effect:

￼

where ￼ represents post-treatment outcomes for individual ￼, ￼ is the corresponding baseline measure, and ￼ is a vector of pre-treatment covariates (e.g., age, education, baseline income). The coefficient of interest, ￼, measures the average treatment effect of TUBI. Robust standard errors are clustered at the household level to account for within-household correlations.

4. Results

4.1. Labor Supply

Table 1 reports the estimated effects of TUBI on labor supply outcomes. Overall, the coefficient on the TUBI indicator (￼) for employment status is 0.017 (p-value = 0.08), suggesting a modest but non-negligible increase of 1.7 percentage points in the probability of being employed. The effect on hours worked is small and not statistically significant at conventional levels. However, we observe a marginally significant increase in monthly earnings among younger workers (ages 18–34), likely reflecting reduced liquidity constraints on job-related investments (e.g., transport, relocation costs).

4.2. Job Search and Skill Acquisition

For unemployed individuals at baseline, TUBI appears to have fostered greater engagement in formal job search and training activities (coefficient = 0.085, p-value = 0.03). Field interviews suggest that reduced financial stress allowed recipients to engage in more strategic job search, potentially avoiding the immediate pressure to take suboptimal or precarious employment.

4.3. Financial Security and Subjective Wellbeing

We find a strong and statistically significant effect on self-reported measures of financial security. Treatment households were more likely to report having emergency savings (coefficient = 0.134, p-value < 0.01). Moreover, TUBI recipients scored higher on mental health indices, reporting lower symptoms of stress and anxiety (Cohen’s d = 0.23). These improvements in wellbeing corroborate theories that relieving financial scarcity can foster both psychological and economic benefits (Mullainathan & Shafir, 2013).

4.4. Heterogeneous Effects

Subgroup analysis reveals larger positive impacts for women and younger adults. Women in TUBI households were more likely to participate in the formal labor market (employment coefficient = 0.028, p-value = 0.05). Qualitative evidence from post-program interviews indicates that the transfer allowed them to pay for childcare or reduce the burden of household tasks. Meanwhile, the youngest cohort reported increased transitions into higher-paying jobs, suggesting that the transfer enabled risk-taking or skill-acquisition that boosted earnings potential.

5. Discussion

Our findings lend support to the argument that providing temporary, unconditional cash transfers can improve labor market outcomes and enhance economic security. While the average treatment effects on labor supply are modest, they do not substantiate the prevailing worry that a basic income would significantly reduce work effort. Instead, we observe suggestive evidence of a positive effect on earnings and job search for certain groups. Additionally, the significant improvements in financial wellbeing and mental health highlight the broader social benefits of income stability.

However, our results should be interpreted with caution. The TUBI program was temporary and relatively small compared to some UBI proposals. Recipients may have treated it as a stepping stone, making it less likely to reduce labor supply in the same way a permanent, larger-scale program might. It is also possible that the short-run timeframe of our study may not capture longer-term adjustments in work effort or household dynamics.

6. Conclusion

This paper provides rare experimental evidence on the short-run effects of a Temporary Universal Basic Income in a middle- to high-income context. Contrary to some prominent criticisms, we find little evidence that TUBI suppresses labor supply. Instead, for subgroups such as women, younger individuals, and the unemployed, the transfer appears to increase employment, earnings, and measures of subjective wellbeing. These findings underscore the importance of direct empirical testing in evaluating large-scale social policies.

Further research should investigate long-term impacts of unconditional transfers, potential effects on macroeconomic indicators (e.g., inflation, wage growth), and policy design considerations (e.g., optimal transfer size, duration). While our study offers a crucial first step, a more comprehensive body of evidence is needed to inform the policy debate around universal basic incomes.
