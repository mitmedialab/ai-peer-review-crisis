Abstract
The study investigates the impact of remittances on the real exchange rate of West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ)
member countries by using annual data from six countries from 1960 to 2022. The WAMZ member countries are
Ghana, The Gambia, Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Remittances are important sources of foreign capital
for developing countries including WAMZ. The study is unique because it examines three periods namely: PreWAMZ (1960-2000), During WAMZ (2001-2022) and the entire period (1960-2022); captures and compares how
the increase in receipt of migrant remittances have affected the real exchange rate for the different periods given the
huge increase in remittances in the last two decades; use updated data for longer period; shows how the different
explanatory variables changes in the three periods examined. Multicollinearity tests, results reveal no
multicollinearity among the variables.
Keywords: Remittance; Real exchange rate; Panel data; West African Monetary Zone.
INTRODUCTION
Remittances from migrants pose an important source of income for households in many
developing countries. The value is rising and its role in promoting better living conditions
and economic performance are very important and visible. Acosta et al., (2006) posit that
migrant remittances are driven by increased international migration, technological
advancement and financial competitiveness and these result in the fall in the cost of
transmitting funds from one part of the world to another part. Migrant remittance is
ranked second most important source of external funding for developing countries after
foreign direct investment (Mallick & Mahallick, 2005; World Bank, 2014; Zouhaier, 2019).
Capital inflows have shown to be very important in the economies of developing
countries, especially in the form of private capital inflow which is composed of foreign

direct investment, employee remittance, and portfolio investment. The countries have
witnessed a massive rise in these flows in the recent decades and the composition and
magnitude have witnessed a significant change. Remittances remain one of the major
components of capital flows. The continents of North Africa, South Asia and Middle East
have witnessed a constant increase in the level of remittances in recent years. According
to the World Bank, Nigeria accounted for the highest remittances flow into Sub-Saharan
Africa in 2022. Remittance flow into the Sub-Saharan Africa was $ 53 billion, with Nigeria
having 38% ($ 20.1 billion), next is Ghana and Kenya with $ 4.7 and $ 4.1 billion
respectively (World Bank, 2023). Growth in remittances to Middle East and North Africa
declined by 3.8% to $ 64 billion in 2022 despite strong growth of 12.2% in 2021. The World
Bank report asserts that the overall rise in remittances to the Sub-Saharan African region
have helped several struggling African countries that are grappling with drought, flood,
and debt servicing issues.
Further, governments of many developing countries including WAMZ have since
realized the important role that migrant remittance plays as a source of external finance.
Remittances emanate from migrants when they send money back home to their families;
this serves as an important lifeline for the countries and comprise a share of the gross
domestic product (GDP) for the recipient developing countries.
Research problem
In recent decades, developing countries have received a lot of cross-border remittance
flows. The WAMZ member countries have benefitted from remittances inflow in the form
of transfers to embassies, churches, non-governmental organization which have received
billions of dollars. Although remittances have contributed to the WAMZ member
countries’ economies, these suppositions have not been backed by funding from any
rigorous macro-econometric study (Adenutsi & Ahortor, 2008). The Central banks have
not shown leadership by providing adequate monetary policy formulation to attract
maximum remittances to these countries.
Further, remittances appear to be a challenge in the understanding of the influence of
global finance on national policy choices in the developing countries. Remittance is a
form of capital inflow and has some unusual characteristics such as they are ‘unrequited’
and hence do not result in claims on assets, debt services obligation or contractual
obligations (Brown, 2006; Kapur, 2005).
On the other hand, since purchases of financial or productive assets can be liquidated,
remittances cannot be withdrawn from a country expose and not lumped together with
other capital flows that cause household insecurity or income volatility e.g FDI and
portfolio flows (Ahlquist, 2006; Garrett, 1998; Scheve & Slaughter, 2004). Migrants tend
to increase remittances they send to their countries when their home countries experience

wars, famine or any economic difficulties as these remittances help smooth the income of
families and protect them from the uncertainty and inconsistencies of the global
economy. Financial transfers and inflows from migrants can serve as a form of insurance
for developing countries against exogeneous shocks (Kapur, 2005; Lopez-Cordova &
Olmedo, 2006; Lucas & Stark, 1985).
Motivation of study
The main Objective of this study is to determine the impact of Remittances on the
exchange rates of WAMZ member countries. There is widespread general belief that
remittances have contributed to the economy of WAMZ member countries, but this
assertion has not been backed by many macro-econometric studies. The role played by
the Central bank in monetary policy formulation to attract maximum cross-border
remittances to member countries still lacks some perspectives. Remittances have assisted
receiving countries in poverty and inequality reduction, enhancement of human capital
and financial development, reduction of labor supply, appreciation of real exchange rate
and weaken the tradeable sector of receiving countries.
The research question of this study is to assess the impact of remittances on the currencies
and exchange rate of the WAMZ countries. Remittances flows are largely influenced by
migrants who depart their home countries and community in search of greener pastures
in advanced countries. The continuous increase in migrants to advanced regions also
comes from WAMZ member countries which have contributed significantly to the
upward trend within Sub-Saharan Africa and to continuous increase in remittances
inflows to these countries.
WAMZ is a monetary union. The presence of WAMZ has influenced the flow of
remittances has on the exchange rate. The pre WAMZ period (1960-2000), the during the
WAMZ period (2000-2022) and the entire period (1960-2022) shows how WAMZ has
exhibited different effects of remittances on the exchange rate. Theories such as altruism,
self-interest portfolio management e.t.c have motivated remittances flow and driven by
need to cater for the welfare of relatives back in their home countries and communities.
Contributions of the study
The formation of WAMZ in 2000 has shown some significant effects in the exchange rate
policies of member countries of the WAMZ. Studies reveal that prior to WAMZ
formation, member countries had divergent real exchange rates. After WAMZ formation,
a growing convergence in real exchange rate was observed among four countries namely:

Nigeria, Sierra Leone, the Gambia, and Liberia (Nketiah et al., 2019). The WAMZ member
countries have three exchange rate policy regimes namely fixed exchange rate regime;
the intermediate; and the flexible or free-floating regime. The appropriate exchange rate
regime is a key factor in achieving the proposed single currency (ECO). Given that
WAMZ has the intention of deepening economic integration in the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), the economic cost include the associated nominal
exchange rate flexibility which serves as a policy instrument and buffer for adjusting
asymmetric shocks.
Exchange rate is considered the most important price in an open economy and arguably
the most important macroeconomic policy domain for governments in developing
countries (Cooper, 1999). Remittances are important in influencing exchange rate policy
making in WAMZ member countries, they also influence political institutions, interest
groups and other aspects of the political economy. Remittances alleviate the political costs
of lost monetary policy autonomy especially as they react in a countercyclical way to
economic downturn and then insulate policy makers from economic uncertainty and
volatility.
Remittances contribute in a positive way to the implementation of fixed exchange rates
and have the capacity to act as a surrogate for domestic monetary policy autonomy in the
WAMZ and other developing countries. Using Robert Mundell’s (1961) optimum
currency area framework, Singer (2010) posits that migrant remittances have a similar
function as cross-border government transfers in the way they allow domestic economy
to adjust to fixed exchange rate.

contributes the highest to its’ GDP compared to other WAMZ member countries. This
shows the huge efforts and altruism of their immigrants towards giving back to their
families back home and their country. The study contributes to existing literature and
knowledge on how remittances inflows can be controlled or promoted because it makes
significant contribution to productivity and the economy of WAMZ. Trade is promoted
and economic activities are sustained with remittance inflows.

Null Hypothesis: H0: Remittances have no significant impact on the Exchange rate in
WAMZ.
Alternative Hypothesis: HA: Remittances have significant impact on the Exchange rate in
WAMZ.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Theoretical review
Several studies capture the effect of remittances on the exchange rate. Hassan and Holmes
(2013), Lartey et al (2012) and Maklouhf and Mughal (2013) assert that persistent inflows
of remittances exercise upward pressure on the long run real exchange rate, which then
results in Dutch disease effects related to a decline in the competitiveness of receipts’
countries tradeable sectors. Given the interests in Fiscal Policy, Abdih et al (2012a) place
emphasis on the impact of remittances on government revenues, then estimate for several
recipient countries, the fiscal implications of the cut back in worldwide remittances in
2009 emanating from the global financial crisis. Abdih et al (2012b) investigate the
adverse impact that remittances have on the quality of institutions through two main
channels namely: the expansion in the revenue base distorts government incentive which
lowers the cost of appropriating resources for its own purpose; and the supplemental
income available to households increases their ability to purchase goods and substitutes
for government services.
Furthermore, Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo (2004) examine the impact of workers’
remittances on real exchange rate using a panel of 13 Latin America and Caribbean
countries. Using instrumenting for remittances leads to a conclusion that remittances
appreciate real exchange rate in remittance-receiving countries. Hence, remittances have
the potential to enforce economic costs on the export sector of receiving countries by
reducing their ability to compete internationally. They utilize a set of variables that are
related to remittance -receiving countries as instruments for remittances. Ball et al, (2013)

utilize a panel consisting of 21 countries and show theoretically and empirically that
remittances appreciate real exchange rate under both flexible exchange rate regime and
fixed exchange rate.
Empirical Review
Edwards (1989) attempts to explain exchange rate volatility by using a theoretical model
to capture the long run and short run fluctuations that exist in the exchange rate of
developing countries. He displayed a dynamic small open economy model to explain the
effect of nominal and real variables on the real exchange rate. The theoretical model
posited that equilibrium real exchange rate is determined by real variables which can
affect the long run equilibrium real exchange rate and the model was tested using 12
developing countries with data from 1962 to 1985. The results reveal that nominal
variables affect the real exchange rate only in the short run while in the long run, the real
exchange rate is affected by only real variables. Ahmed (2009) affirmed the Dutch disease
hypothesis for Pakistan by estimating a linear regression model using variables namely
Terms of trade, government spending, degree of openness, workers remittances, Foreign
direct Investment (FDI) and real exchange rate.
METHODOLOGY
Theoretical model
Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962) provide a framework for how macroeconomic
policies are conducted in the presence of capital flows. The Mundell-Fleming model is an
extension of the IS-LM model in an open economy setting with the hallmark assumption
of sticky prices (Mark, 2001). Traditionally, the Mundell – Fleming models generally deal
with fiscal and monetary policy effectiveness in the presence of global capital mobility
that exist within the regimes of flexible or fixed exchange rate. These models could
predict the impact of domestic and external shocks and the co-movement of
macroeconomic variables at home and abroad.
The modification and incorporation have produced two types of models namely
(Adenutsi & Ahortor, 2008):
1) Deterministic Dynamic Mundell-Fleming models, and
2) Stochastic Dynamic Mundell-Fleming models.
Empirical model
To examine the impact of remittance inflows on exchange rate, a model takes cognizance
of various theories and outcome of previous empirical research such as Gapen & Montiel
(2008), Quartey (2006), Vargas-Lundius (2004), Rapport & Docquier (2006) were specified.
The empirical model takes insights from the theoretical model in the choice of variables

for the model and shows the relevance of the variables in explaining the theoretical
framework and relationship. The justification for the variables is backed by economic
theory on how the variables individually influence the personal remittances and it
expresses the functional relationship between the dependent variable and these
independent variables.
In the light of the above and drawing insights from Nketiah et al., (2019), Loto and Alao
(2016), and McMahon(1998) models, this model posits that real exchange rate is a
function of per capital remittances received, per capita income, trade openness, ratio of
government expenditure to GDP and capita flow.

Method of analysis
The nature of the study entails the use of panel data for the period 1960 – 2022. Panel data
is apt because it can identify parameters in the occurrence of measurement error and have
robustness to omitted variables and the capture the efficiency of parameter estimates. The
panel robust least squares (Panel RLS) estimator would be used to estimate the model for
impact of remittance on exchange rate in WAMZ. The variables would be tested for unit
root and cointegration test would be performed to determine if there is a long-run
relationship among variables of the model or not.
The study captures three periods to enable us to explain the effect of WAMZ. The three
periods are:
o Pre-WAMZ period (1960-2000)
o During WAMZ period (2000-2022)
o Entire Period (1960-2022).
Data description
The data type is secondary data, and it uses a panel data set for the six countries of
WAMZ. The countries comprise Nigeria, the Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ghana and
Liberia. WAMZ is our focus because it is an important monetary union that is
instrumental in the promotion of regional integration and development of sub-Saharan
Africa and provides an institutional framework that policy discussion and
implementation. The period of study is 1960-2022 based on availability of data.
Research Question
How does remittance impact the exchange rate and currencies of the WAMZ countries?

The Impact of Remittances on Exchange Rates in West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ)
12  
Remittances can propel the growth of new small-scale businesses and then foster
entrepreneurship by relaxing credit constraint for receiving countries. Remittances can
mitigate the exchange rate volatility derived from the outflow and export by providing
an indirect stabilizing effect of exchange rate volatility in times when other kinds of
capital flows experience fluctuations and then offer regular source of foreign currency
into the receiving country economy.
Data from six WAMZ countries from 1960 to 2021 would be used to investigate the impact
of remittances on real exchange rates and net exports.
Net exports will require the instruments to address endogeneity of worker’s remittances
and the instrumental variables are: weighted average per capita GNI, unemployment rate
and real interest rate of remittance sending countries
Model
We use a panel of 6 countries in WAMZ to analyze how workers’ remittances affect real
exchange rate and net exports. We estimate the relationship and can be written as:
Εit = β0 + β1Rit + β2Iit + β3OPit + β4Xit + β5CFit + αi + δt + Ɛt
Where:
Eit = real exchange rate
Rit = per capita remittances received by country I at year t
Iit = Per capita income
TOPit = Trade Openness = (import + export/GDP)
Xit = ratio of government expenditure to GDP
CFit = Capital flow (FDI + foreign aid)
δt= time fixed effect
αi = country fixed effect
Ɛit = Error term
ε = Error term
Based on apriori expectations, we expect that:
β1 > 0, β2 > 0, β3 > 0, β4 </> 0, β5> 0
The real exchange rate for the country I at time t is defined as
Εit = eit x Pus/Pit
Where:

eit=nominal exchange rate
Pit = price index
Pus = US price
Price index can be the GDP deflator or CPI.
Estimation techniques
The OLS regression technique will be used to analyze the data. Stationary tests,
heteroskedasticity, Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root tests will be applied.
Additionally, Fixed effect, cointegration and stability tests will be applied. Descriptive
statistics and diagnostic testing such as the Multicollinearity and Pearson correlation test
will be implemented in this study.

The average real exchange rate of Liberia is the highest among the six countries of WAMZ
for the 63-year period while Nigeria recorded the lowest average real exchange rate
among the WAMZ countries for the same period (Table 1). Ghana recorded the highest
maximum value for the real exchange rate while Nigeria recorded the least minimum
value for the real exchange rate. The kurtosis and skewness statistics measure the
departure from symmetry and peaked ness of the distribution respectively. The data
collected show that the positive skewness is quantitatively high, and this justifies the high

level of the peak value. Additionally, the high real exchange rate for Liberia implies that
Liberia is losing its competitive edge more and the exports are more expensive while the
imports are less expensive. The increase in productivity tend to lead to lower production
costs and lead to a rise in the real exchange rate. On the other hand, Nigeria with the
lowest real exchange rate implies that it gains some competitive edge, the exports are
cheaper while the imports are more expensive. Nketiah et al (2019) posit that increase in
capital flows is a function of stock of assets and liabilities in the economy and increase in
net foreign assets leads to changes in the real equilibrium exchange rate. Remittance
affects the real exchange rate through their impact on growth. Even though the impact
on growth is uncertain from our results, Lopez et al., (2007) assert that remittances lead
to a significant appreciation in real exchange rate.
Panel data regression
The panel data regression involves five explanatory variables and the dependent variable
of real exchange rate. Regression was done for three periods to enable us to compare the
impact on the variable during the various changing times. The first period is the preWAMZ period (1960-2000), the second period is during the WAMZ (2001-2022) and the
third period is the entire period of study (1960-2022).

In the pre-WAMZ era, the variables per capita remittance and capital inflow were
statistically significant while the variables per capita income, Gross final consumption
expenditure and trade openness were not significant (Table 2). This implies that we reject
the null hypothesis and conclude that Remittances have significant impact on real
exchange rate for the variables per capita remittance and capital flow while we fail to
reject the null hypothesis and conclude that remittances have no effect on exchange rate
for the variables Per capita income, Gross final consumption expenditure and Trade.
Also, for per capita remittance, one unit increase will result in an increase in the real
exchange rate by 9.65905 while holding other variables constant. From the result, the
positive relationship between per capita remittance and real exchange rate is in
consonance with Economic theory. An increase in remittance causes an appreciation of
the exchange rate, increase in the capital account and external imbalance. Giving the
increasing population to explain the per capita remittance, the remittances received will
lead to appreciation of the real exchange rate. For the capital inflow, the negative
relationship in the result is not in consonance with economic theory. This means that if
the capital inflow increases by one unit, then the real exchange rate decreases by 2.25E -
07 while holding other variables constant. An increase in capital inflow leads to currency
appreciation, but a decrease in net exports and aggregate demand. Capital inflow
produces high demand for both tradeable and non-tradeable goods which leads to higher
relative prices of non- tradeable goods and appreciation of the real exchange rate.

The five explanatory variables are per capita income, per capita remittance, Government
final consumption expenditure, capital inflow and trade openness (Table 3). Among
these, only the Government final consumption expenditure is statistically significant
while the remaining four variables are not significant. The Government final
consumption expenditure is highly statistically significant; hence we reject the null
hypothesis and conclude that the variable has a significant impact on the real exchange
rate. Since the variables per capita income, per capita remittance, capital inflow and trade
openness are not significant, we conclude that they do not have impact on the real
exchange rate during WAMZ. If the Government consumption expenditure increases by
one unit, we expect the real exchange rate to increase by 13.00792 while holding other
variables constant. While Government purchases and expenditure causes the real
exchange rate to appreciate, increase in consumption in developing countries especially
WAMZ leads to depreciation of the real exchange rate.

The five independent variables witnessed changes in the three periods of study (Table 4).
For the per capita income, the coefficient was negative in the entire period, positive in the

pre-WAMZ period and negative in the during the WAMZ period. For the per capita
remittance, the coefficient was negative for the entire period, positive for the pre-WAMZ
period and positive for the during the WAMZ period. For the Government consumption
expenditure, the coefficient is positive during the entire period, negative during the preWAMZ period and positive during the WAMZ period. For the Capital flow, the
coefficient was negative for the entire period, pre-WAMZ and during WAMZ period, but
statistically significant for only the pre-WAMZ period. For the Trade openness, the
coefficient was positive in the entire period, negative in the pre-WAMZ period and
positive in the during the WAMZ period.
Further, from the regression result for the entire period, none of the five explanatory
variables were statistically significant, hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis and
conclude that all of them do not have significant impact on the real exchange rate. For the
per capita income, if it increases by one unit of the dollar, this leads to a decrease in the
real exchange rate by 0.0225783 while holding other variables constant. Per capita income
is a measure of economic growth, and a high real exchange rate stimulates economic
growth. For the per capita remittance, a one unit increase in the per capita remittance
received leads to a decrease in the real exchange rate by 0.454901 while holding other
variables constant. Economic theory posits that an increase in per capita remittances lead
appreciation of the real exchange rate, increase in capital account and external imbalance.
For the Gross final consumption expenditure, an increase of one unit is expected to
increase the real exchange rate by 1.476916 while holding other variables constant.
Increase in government spending stimulates the aggregate demand and causes some real
GDP growth and real exchange rate appreciation. The Government expenditure can
influence the real exchange rate potentially through the resource withdrawal channel and
the consumption tilting channel.
The capital flow has a negative relationship with the real exchange rate for the entire
period. If the capital inflow increases by one unit, then the real exchange rate decreases
by 1.71E-08 while holding other variables constant. An increase in capital inflow leads to
real exchange rate appreciation and a reduction in net exports and aggregate demand.
Capital inflow produces a higher demand for both tradeable and non-tradeable goods
and then higher relative price for non-tradeable goods. Capital inflow increases the
domestic resources needed to produce non-tradeable goods needed to meet the increase
in demand. Also, the trade openness has a positive relationship with the real exchange
rate and a one unit increase in the trade openness is expected to increase the real exchange
rate by 0.143473 while holding other variables constant. An increase in the trade openness

leads to absorption of more real shocks by the currency market which affects nominal
shocks. In an open economy, fluctuations in the exchange rate leads to expectations of a
depreciation on the national currency.
Correlations
The Pearson correlation test is important because it measures the strength and direction
of linear relationship between two variables. It is used to evaluate the strength of
association between data and variables. The variables have positive and negative
association present among the six variables including real exchange rate.

Real exchange rate has relationship with all the variables (Table 5). Real exchange rate
has perfect positive relationship with itself, the relationship with per capita remittance is
considered as negligible correlation, negative and there is insufficient statistical evidence
that the correlation between two variables is significant. Given that there exists a negative
correlation between real exchange rate and per capita remittance, it implies that both
variables move in opposite direction and do not move in tandem. When the real exchange
rate increases, the per capita remittances decreases and vice versa. Similarly, the real
exchange rate has a negative relationship with the per capita income, shows negligible

correlation and there is insufficient statistical evidence that the correlation between two
variables is significant. The negative relationship implies that when the real exchange
rate increases, then the per capita income decreases and vice versa.
Additionally, the trade openness has a positive relationship with the real exchange rate.
It has negligible correlation and there is insufficient statistical evidence that correlation
between two variables is significant. The positive relationship implies that the real
exchange rate and trade openness move in tandem; if the real exchange rate increases,
then the trade openness also increases and if it decreases, the trade openness also
decreases. The real exchange rate has a positive relationship with the Government final
consumption expenditure. The correlation is negligible and there is insufficient statistical
evidence that the correlation between the two variables is significant. The positive
relationship between the real exchange rate and Government final consumption
expenditure implies that both variables move in tandem with each other and as one
variable decreases, the other variable also decreases.
For the capital flow, it has a negative correlation with the real exchange rate. The
correlation is negligible and there is insufficient statistical evidence that the correlation
between the two variables is significant. The negative correlation implies a negative
relation between the capital flow and the real exchange rate, and they do not move in
tandem. If the capital flow increases, then the real exchange rate decreases and if the real
exchange rate increases, then the capital flow decreases.
Overall, the variables have 36 points of correlation with one another, and the correlations
are either positive or negative. Apart from the perfect correlations present, the highest is
the correlation between capital inflow and per capita income. The correlation coefficient
is 0.775 and it suggests that there is a high positive correlation between the capital inflow
and per capital income for the 63-year period in WAMZ. Both variables move in tandem
and have a high positive association. In the entire correlation result, there is no
multicollinearity. This is because the correlation coefficients are less than 0.8.

exchange rate is explained by per capita income, per capita remittance, Government final
consumption expenditure, capital inflow and trade openness while the remaining 94.2%
of the variation is unaccounted for. The standard error of 215.943 is high. The standard
error is intuitively the standard deviation of a sampling distribution, and it depicts how
much disparity there is likely to be between the point of estimates obtained from a sample
relative to the true population of the mean. From the high value, it is obvious that that
the disparity is quite large.

The regression shows that there exists a relationship between real exchange rate and per
capital remittance, real exchange rate and per capita income, real exchange rate and
Government final consumption expenditure, real exchange rate and capital inflow, and
real exchange rate and trade openness. The ANOVA result (Table 7) is important because
it informs us that there are significant differences between the means of three or more
groups. Also, the test result is statistically significant, and it implies that at least one
group’s mean differs from others. The ‘between’ variance is much larger than the ‘within’
variance and the factor level impacts the mean of the distribution of the variables. The
test shows that F-test and adjusted R-squared in the model specification provided
evidence that the explanatory variables are jointly not equal to zero, but not a good fit of
the model.
Coefficients
The coefficients and their values tell us the relationship each value has with the
dependent variable, the real exchange rate (Table 8). There is a negative relationship
between the real exchange rate and per capita remittance, capital inflow and per capita
income. There is a positive relationship between real exchange rate and the Government
final consumption expenditure and trade openness. From the result, none of the variables
is statistically significant. This means that none of the variables is a useful predictor of
the real exchange rate. Also, the VIF statistics is an indicator to inform us of the presence
of multicollinearity or not. Since (Variance Inflation Factor) VIF of 5-10 signifies

multicollinearity, there is NO multicollinearity in the results. This is because all the VIF
statistics are less than 5.

The no multicollinearity in the results means that the independent variables are not
highly correlated with each other. This means that each predictor makes some important
contributions in explaining the outcome. A significant amount of information present in
one predictor is not contained in other predictors. The statistical significance of
independent variables is NOT undermined.
How has the remittances impacted the exchange rate and economy of WAMZ?
From the results, the correlation coefficient between the predictors and the Variance
Inflation Factor (VIF) is considered the most used method by statisticians to test
multicollinearity. The values range between 1.19 and 3.43 leads to the conclusion where
we fail to reject the null hypothesis of no multicollinearity. There is no multicollinearity,
hence the statistical inferences are reliable, and the independent variables interact and
affect each other. The Pearson correlation test did show that there exist relationships
between real exchange rate and all five independent variables chosen in the model. The
relationship was either positive or negative. Per capita remittance variable is proxy for
the remittance, and it shows a negative relationship with the real exchange rate. There is
negligible correlation, and both variables move in opposite direction. An increase in per
capita remittance leads to a decrease in the real exchange rate.
Since the creation of WAMZ in 2000, exchange rate stability has been one of the major
goals of the monetary union. Many WAMZ and Sub-Saharan African countries have

22  
exchange rate stability as one of their monetary policy objectives. The creation of WAMZ
has led to better coordination and more inflow of FDI and remittances from migrants
who are citizens but live abroad. The remittances and capital inflow has led to the
appreciation of the real exchange rate in the member countries. Hence, there has been a
huge increase in remittance to member countries which have served as sources of
livelihood for many families and an important component of the GDP of these countries.
The increase in remittances has been driven by having many WAMZ citizens abroad,
increased interest/request by home governments, altruism from migrants who live and
work abroad. The increase in remittance, which is a component of inflows into the
economy has increased consumption in the economy, led to the appreciation of the real
exchange, increased the domestic economy, but have not achieved exchange rate stability.
CONCLUSION
International migrants are assiduous in their host countries and save a portion of their
income in savings which they remit a part of their savings to their families back home for
either support or investment. Remittances are expected to help improve the economy of
remittance-receiving countries, but it is not always true. Remittances have the potential
of appreciating the real exchange rate of the remittance-receiving countries, hence
weakening the competitiveness of their economy, and reducing their exports. We
discover that for all the WAMZ countries, an average of 10% increase in per capita
remittance will lead to 4.54% reduction (appreciation) in the real exchange rate. The total
per capita remittance received by WAMZ countries rose from $ 115 million in 1960 to $
26.5 billion in 2022.
Moreover, the study examined the impact of remittances on the exchange rate of the
WAMZ countries. To analyze the impact of remittances, the ordinary least square method
was chosen. The study used time series data and panel data regression for the five
explanatory variables that influenced the exchange rate over the 63-year period.
Correlation, Multicollinearity and ANOVA tests were done, and we found that many of
the variables possessed negligible correlation. Among the explanatory variables, some
have a positive relationship with the real exchange rate while others have a negative
relationship. The correlation result shows that many were negligible correlation except
for per capita income/capital flow, per-capita remittance/per capita income which
recorded a high positive correlation, and few others have moderate and low correlation.
The F test and adjusted R squared in the model specification show evidence that the
explanatory variables are jointly not equal to zero and does not have goodness of fit for
the entire period.
Further, the study analyzed the impact using three periods namely: Pre-WAMZ era
(1960-2000), during WAMZ era (2001-2022) and the entire period (1960-2022). The 
Journal of Applied Economics and Business
23
regression results of the variables in the three period differ. In the pre-WAMZ period, the
per capita remittance and capital inflow had significant impact on the real exchange rate.
In the during the WAMZ era, the Government final consumption expenditure was
statistically significant and had an impact on the real exchange rate. In the entire period,
none of the variables were significant. The analysis shows that a long run relationship
(co-integration) exists among the variables in the entire period. The pre-WAMZ period
does not show long run relationship while the during the WAMZ period shows long run
relationship for some of the variables.
The research further real that in the entire period, the per capita income, per capita
remittance, and capital inflow result in the appreciation of the real exchange rate in
WAMZ. The negative relationship with the real exchange rate shows that the variables
move in the opposite direction with the real exchange rate and such leads to appreciation.
In the pre-WAMZ period, the government consumption expenditure and capital inflow
are the variables that propelled the real exchange rate appreciation while in the during
the WAMZ period, the per capita income and capital inflow caused the appreciation of
the real exchange rate. The Granger causality tests, the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and
the Unit root tests reveal that some variables were significant in their impact on the real
exchange rate.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The analysis reveal important issues and we recommend the following:
1) Need for more understanding and emphasis on the economic importance of
remittances in the WAMZ member countries’ economies.
2) Need to study the consequences of remittance on the export sector because of real
exchange rate appreciation that emanates from increasing flows of remittances.
3) The increasing level of remittances has attracted a lot of consideration in WAMZ
especially in the last two decades, therefore this calls for new opportunities. More
opportunities for investment expenditure on capital goods which will boost
income, stimulate production, and increase exports.
4) Need for governments of WAMZ member countries to create investment vehicles
such as diaspora bond to encourage the citizens of WAMZ member countries who
are immigrants working abroad to contribute towards national development.
