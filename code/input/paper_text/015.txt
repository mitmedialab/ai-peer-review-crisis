Who Gets Vaccinated? Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Predictors of Individual Behaviour in Pandemics

Abstract
This study investigates different cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics associated with individuals' willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and their actual vaccination status. Our empirical analysis is based on data obtained from three survey waves conducted in 2021 among about 2,000 individuals living in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. We find that individuals with a high level of trait reactance – a personality characteristic that entails the personal tendency to perceive persuasion attempts as restricting one's freedom – display a significantly lower willingness to get vaccinated. They also tend to get inoculated later or never. Moreover, neuroticism, locus of control, and statistical numeracy appear to be associated with the willingness to get vaccinated, but these results are less pronounced and less robust. Our results indicate that vaccination campaigns and policies could be improved by specifically addressing those with a high level of trait reactance.

1 Introduction
Starting at the end of 2019, the Covid-19 pandemic spread out to the entire world quickly and forced many governments to implement public health measures. To decelerate infection and hospitalization dynamics, authorities mandated, for example, the use of face masks and compliance with regulations to keep distance. As vaccines became available in 2020, particular hope was placed on vaccination campaigns, since inoculation is shown to prevent infections with Covid-19 from turning into severe cases and may even prevent infections altogether (CDC, 2022). The effectiveness of public health measures, including vaccination campaigns, depends critically on popular acceptance of and adherence to these measures. However, in many countries, there has been reluctance or refusal to follow the health guidelines and even strong protests against some of these measures, especially against vaccination requirements.

The search for explanations for this reluctance and refusal has led to a large body of research since the outbreak of the pandemic. Behavioural research has identified important cultural and group-level characteristics including a lack of trust (Bargain and Aminjonov, 2020), political polarization (Allcott et al., 2020) and cultural individualism (Bazzi, Fiszbein, and Gebresilasse, 2021; Chen, Frey, and Presidente, 2021) as important determinants of reluctance to follow health guidelines. On the individual level, Alfaro et al. (2022) and Fang et al. (2022) identified prosociality and social preferences as factors fostering compliance.

With this paper, we complement these lines of research by focusing on the role of cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics. Cognitive characteristics such as statistical numeracy can be expected to be relevant to vaccination decisions because they may contribute to an individual's ability to categorize the disparate statistical information released during the pandemic and to make an informed decision based on that information. In addition, non-cognitive characteristics, such as personality traits, may play an important role in vaccination decisions, for example, by moderating recipients' reactions to persuasive messages (Hirsh, Kang, and Bodenhausen, 2012), by shaping an individual's proneness to experience certain emotions (Widiger and Oltmanns, 2017), or by determining an individual's tendency to behave prosocially (Andor et al., 2022).

Specifically, we examine the association of trait reactance, neuroticism, locus of control beliefs, as well as statistical numeracy with individuals' vaccination status and willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19.1 Our analysis is based on three waves of survey data of more than 2,000 individuals living in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia collected between May and November 2021. As our main outcome, we observe the self-reported vaccination status and, if the person is not yet vaccinated, the stated willingness to get vaccinated. For brevity, we refer to our main categorical outcome variable hereafter as the willingness to get vaccinated, which includes the revealed preference of already being vaccinated as one category.

Our results indicate that the willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19 decreases significantly with an increasing level of trait reactance, a personality characteristic that entails the personal tendency to perceive persuasion attempts as restricting one's freedom. Neuroticism, locus of control and statistical numeracy also appear to be associated with the willingness to get vaccinated, but these results are less pronounced and less robust with regard to the econometric specification than the results regarding trait reactance. The estimation of an Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model further shows that individuals with a high level of trait reactance get vaccinated significantly later than those with a low or medium level of trait reactance, while the remaining characteristics do not seem to be associated with the timing of vaccination.

The results regarding trait reactance contribute to prior research in medicine and psychology, which has shown that trait reactance is negatively associated with individual efforts to follow official health recommendations (Díaz and Cova, 2022) as well as with vaccination intentions (Drażkowski and Trepanowski, 2022). We complement these findings by showing that trait reactance is strongly associated with actual vaccination behaviour and that this association is of high economic significance, as the likelihood of being vaccinated against Covid-19 is 9 percentage points lower in the group of respondents with high trait reactance. Our results further suggest that higher levels of neuroticism, which have been shown to be related to self-protective behaviour or adherence to public protection policies (e.g. Kroencke et al., 2020), do not seem to play a major role with regard to vaccination behaviour. The same holds with regard to the roles of locus of control (Devereux, Miller, and Kirshenbaum, 2021; Olagoke, Olagoke, and Hughes, 2021) and statistical numeracy (Lau et al., 2022). Overall, our results underpin the importance of considering reactance when designing health policies and health communication campaigns (Reynolds-Tylus, 2019; Ball and Wozniak, 2022). Specifically, we conclude that campaigns and policies intended to encourage the unvaccinated to get inoculated should be specifically targeted at those with a high level of trait reactance.

The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we provide a detailed description of our data set. In section III, we present empirical evidence on the relationship between cognitive and non-cognitive traits and individuals' vaccination status and willingness to get vaccinated. Section IV presents the results of an AFT model to analyse the duration until first vaccination. Section V puts the empirical results into perspective by reflecting on our key findings in comparison to the existing literature. In section VI, we discuss limitations of our study. Section VII concludes.

2 Data
Our empirical analysis is based on data obtained from three survey waves of about 2,000 individuals living in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia conducted by RWI – Leibniz Institute for Economic Research in cooperation with the survey institute forsa throughout the year 2021. The first survey took place between 7 and 16 May (Wave 1), followed by two additional waves collected between 26 July and 21 August (Wave 2) and 20 October and 11 November (Wave 3), respectively. For Wave 2 and Wave 3, we re-sampled as many participants from Wave 1 as possible to establish a panel data structure. The survey population consisted of a sub-sample of forsa's household panel. forsa maintains a large panel of potential survey participants that is representative for the population of German-speaking internet users. The data collection occurred as part of a research project that aimed at evaluating the epidemiological, economic and social effects of a controlled redemption of the severe lock-down measures imposed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic in certain municipalities of North Rhine-Westphalia.2 These so-called Model Municipalities have been over-sampled during the collection of the data, i.e., half of the survey participants live in these municipalities. The surveys were conducted online using a tool that can be accessed on computers, tablets and smart phones. The target group were persons aged 18 and above.

Approximately 3,000 respondents participated per survey wave. For our estimation sample, we consider only those individuals who participated in all three waves, which are 2,317 participants. Additionally, we exclude 100 participants who did not answer all questions relevant for our analysis, i.e., questions on their willingness to get vaccinated (elicited in all three survey waves) and their month of vaccination if they have already received their first vaccination dose (elicited in Wave 2), questions on cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics, as well as on age, gender and education level (elicited in Wave 1). To obtain information on individuals' willingness to get vaccinated, we asked in May 2021: ‘Vaccinations against Corona started in Germany at the end of December. Have you already been vaccinated against Corona, will you get vaccinated as soon as you have the chance, or would you rather wait or not get vaccinated at all?’, allowing the following answers:
‘I have already been vaccinated against Corona’ (Vaccinated)
‘Will get vaccinated as soon as I have the chance’ (Willing)
‘Will rather wait’ (Waiting)
‘Will not be vaccinated at all’ (Unwilling)
‘Don't know / not specified’
We count the 13 respondents who reported that they did not know or preferred not to specify their vaccination status as part of the 100 excluded participants who did not answer all questions relevant to our analysis. In addition, we delete 37 respondents from the sample as they provided inconsistent responses with regard to their vaccination dates.3 The final estimation sample consists of 2,180 individuals (see Figure 1 for a visual representation of the exclusions).4

Exclusions from the final estimation sample
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the willingness to get vaccinated in May 2021 as it appears in our final sample. A majority of 65% of the respondents was already vaccinated in May 2021, and most of the respondents who were not yet vaccinated were at least willing to get vaccinated (28% of the sample). Only a minority of about 4% and 3% of the individuals in our sample preferred to wait or reported to not get vaccinated at all, respectively. More detailed descriptive information on the distribution of the willingness to get vaccinated across socio-economic groups is presented in Table A4.

Vaccination status and willingness to get vaccinated in May 2021
In Wave 2, conducted in July and August 2021, we asked the respondents who were already vaccinated at this point in time (94.6%) about the month in which they received their first vaccination dose. These vaccination dates were influenced by a priority scheme imposed by the German government to ensure that the most vulnerable groups for infections were vaccinated first. From the start of the vaccination campaign in December 2020 until 6 April 2021, persons aged 80 or older as well as persons who work in nursing, elderly care, and health care were prioritized. From 7 April 2021, to 6 May 2021, the prioritization was extended to persons aged 70 or older as well as to chronically ill persons and their close relatives or caregivers, contact persons of pregnant persons, as well as persons in public service, such as the police, fire department, and school service. From 7 May 2021, to 6 June 2021, the prioritization was further extended to persons aged 60 or older and to further professional groups that have a lot of contact with customers or work in system-relevant utilities. From 7 June 2021, there was no longer any special prioritization and everyone could get vaccinated.

Figure 3 contrasts the vaccination intentions elicited in Wave 1 with the vaccination timing elicited in Wave 2. It appears that the large majority of those who stated in May that they will get vaccinated as soon as possible indeed got vaccinated in May, June or July. Only a small share of this group was still not vaccinated at the time of Wave 2 (3.4%). In contrast, 57.5% of those who stated that they would rather wait before getting vaccinated in Wave 1 and 82.3% of those who stated no intention to get vaccinated at all were still not vaccinated in Wave 2.

Table 1 presents summary statistics of the outcome and explanatory variables used in our empirical analysis. The latter can be categorized into two groups: Variables describing the cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics of the individuals in our sample, which are in the focus of this study, and socio-economic characteristics. We measured five different cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics that we considered relevant to vaccination decisions based on the scientific literature5 as well as theoretical considerations: trait reactance, neuroticism, locus of control and statistical numeracy.

Trait reactance is proxied using three selected items of the Hong Psychological Reactance Scale (Hong and Faedda, 1996). The personality construct that this scale is supposed to measure is psychological reactance, defined as ‘the motivational state that is hypothesized to occur when a freedom is eliminated or threatened with elimination’ (Brehm and Brehm, 1981, p. 37) and ‘reactance produces a desire to restore one's attitudinal or behavioral freedom’ (Shen and Dillard, 2005, p. 74). While reactance can be viewed as a motivational state, it is argued that it can also be viewed as a personality trait that determines a person's proneness to feel and act in a reactant manner (Shen and Dillard, 2005).

Neuroticism was retrieved using the neuroticism-related items of the Big Five Inventory (BFI-S) that is used in the German Socio-Economic Panel (Schupp and Gerlitz, 2008). This personality trait has two poles: neuroticism on one side and emotional stability on the other. Persons who score high on neuroticism have a stronger tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, guilt and depression (Widiger, 2009, p. 129).

Locus of control was captured using the original items of the Psychological Coping Resources component of the Mastery Module by Pearlin and Schooler (1978), which is, for example, also used to measure locus of control in Cobb-Clark and Schurer (2013). Locus of control captures an individual's belief about how strongly events in her life are shaped by own behaviour (Rotter, 1966; Gatz and Karel, 1993). Individuals who believe that events strongly depend on own behaviour have a high internal locus of control, while those believing that events are mainly determined by fate or luck, for instance, have an external locus of control.

Statistical numeracy was measured in two ways. First, we utilized three selected items of Lipkus, Samsa, and Rimer's (2001) extended numeracy scale, which were framed in a health context. These items were relatively simple percentage calculation tasks. Therefore, we used a second indicator of statistical numeracy by employing the short version of the Berlin Numeracy Test proposed by Cokely et al. (2012), which is a more demanding test of statistical numeracy.6

For our empirical analysis, we first calculate the individual mean responses on the Likert scales for all items of each characteristic. Second, we divide the sample for each characteristic into three approximately equally sized categories: Low (the mean of the responses is below the lower tercile), medium (the mean of the responses is between the lower and the upper tercile), high (the mean of the responses is above the upper tercile).7 Exceptions are the measures of statistical numeracy. The measure based on Lipkus et al. (2001) yields only one binary response (correct or incorrect/'don't know') per item. To aggregate the items, we calculate the sum of the correct answers per respondent, which reveals that almost 70% of the respondents answered all items correctly. Since this 70% includes both the lower and the upper tercile, there are only two categories for this measure: Low statistical numeracy (at least one incorrect or ‘don't know’ response) and high statistical numeracy (all responses are correct). Similarly, the short form of the Berlin Numeracy test produces only one binary result (correct or incorrect/'don't know'). Therefore, we use a dummy variable that is 1 if the correct answer to the test was given, which is true for 25% of the individuals in our sample, and 0 if the answer was wrong or the answer option ‘don't know’ was chosen.

Table A5 compares the study sample with the population of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The results show that individuals aged 19–45 are underrepresented in our sample, while the 45–65 and 65–75 age groups are overrepresented. The proportion of women in our sample is slightly lower, while the proportion of college graduates is higher than in the general population. Consistent with the higher average age of the study population, there are more married and fewer employed persons in the sample and fewer persons with children living in the household than in the population. The average income category in the sample is slightly lower than the average net household income in the population. Finally, the proportion of vaccinated individuals in our sample is quite high at 65% compared to 48% in the population of North Rhine-Westphalia, which may also be partly due to the higher average age of our sample.

There are different potential reasons for the differences between the sample and the population. One reason could be the selective probability of continuous participation in all three waves of the survey. To investigate the impact of this selection process, we conduct an additional analysis considering the entire sample of participants in Wave 1, regardless of their participation in subsequent waves (Table A6). We find that the differences between the sample and the population decrease. The remaining differences could be due to differences in the regional distribution, as the ‘Model Municipalities’ were deliberately oversampled. Furthermore, differences between the characteristics of the sample and the population are common when probability sampling is used but participation in the survey is voluntary. Since in a probability sample the selection probabilities are known and some information about the non-participants is available, weights can be used to correct for these differences (see Crossley, Fisher, and Low, 2021, for a discussion of this topic in the context of Covid-19 surveys). In Table A15, we provide results, where we used weights provided by forsa to reweigh the sample such that it matches the population more closely. Besides larger standard errors, which are typical for weighted regression results (see, e.g., Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge, 2015, p. 310), we do not find qualitative differences compared to the unweighted results.8 In particular, the result of lower willingness to get vaccinated among those with higher values on the trait reactance scale remains unchanged by the reweighting.

Finally, our survey sample may differ from the population in terms of unobservable characteristics. Yet, this limitation plays a role in all survey-based studies, including those related to our study (see section V for an overview). Since it is difficult to observe cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics without surveys, all studies in this area have this limitation. Compared to convenience samples and pure online surveys, however, the forsa panel has a decisive advantage that mitigates self-selection effects: The panel members are recruited offline. This means that new candidates for the panel are selected according to a scientifically validated procedure and then asked by telephone whether they would like to become part of the panel. As a result, there is no possibility to self-enrol in the panel, the identity of panel members is verified, and bots cannot be part of the sample. In addition, the offline recruitment process ensures that individuals are targeted independently of the frequency of their internet use, provided that they use the internet at all.

3 Willingness to get vaccinated
To investigate the relationship between cognitive and non-cognitive traits and individuals' willingness to get vaccinated, we estimate regression models of the following form:
(1)
where the dependent variable 
 describes the categorical measure of individual 
's willingness to get vaccinated 
 and the vector 
 encompasses the different indicators of cognitive and non-cognitive traits of individual 
 described in the last section as well as potential confounding factors, including gender, age, and level of education.9 Because of the discrete nature of our dependent variable, equation (1) has been estimated using a Multinomial Logit model, i.e., 
. The estimated coefficients (
) from a Multinomial Logit model are not easy to interpret, especially since a positive (negative) sign of the coefficient does not necessarily imply a positive (negative) direction of the association between 
 and 
 (Cameron and Trivedi, 2005, p. 501). Therefore, it is common practice to report average ‘marginal effects’ that allow a direct interpretation as the percentage point change in the probability of the respective realization of the outcome variable associated with a one unit change in the explanatory variable. Note that we use the term ‘marginal effect’ to follow textbook conventions, describing the transformation of the estimated coefficients into interpretable quantities. The use of the word ‘effect’ here does not imply causality as we study associations between willingness to get vaccinated and cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics.
Table 2 reports the estimated average marginal effects with the willingness to get vaccinated elicited in Wave 1 (May 2021) as the outcome variable. We conduct the analyses in two forms. In the first four columns of Table 2, every panel refers to a separate regression, e.g., Panel A shows the marginal effects obtained from a regression considering only trait reactance and the socioeconomic characteristics as explanatory variables, while ignoring the other characteristics. In the second four columns, all panels result from the same regression model, i.e., the regression model includes all cognitive and non-cognitive traits together with the socio-economic characteristics as explanatory variables.

Notes: The sample is restricted to those respondents who participated in all three waves. Vaccination status and covariate values are from Wave 1. We present the marginal effects of Multinomial Logit models and we control for the respondents' gender, age, and level of education (see Table A7 for the marginal effects of these covariates). Robust SEs are reported in parentheses.
** and * indicate statistical significance at the 1% and 5% level, respectively.
First, we focus on the separate models depicted in the first four columns of Table 2. Panel A of Table 2 suggests that the willingness to get vaccinated is lower for persons with a high level of trait reactance. Compared to individuals with a low level of trait reactance, individuals with a high level of trait reactance are significantly less likely to be vaccinated (by 9.1 percentage points) and significantly more likely to prefer to wait until they get vaccinated (by 4.7 percentage points) or to be unwilling to get vaccinated at all (by 5.6 percentage points). The evidence appears to be somewhat less clear when we consider neuroticism (Panel B of Table 2). While individuals with a high level of neuroticism display a significantly lower probability of being unwilling to get vaccinated (by 1.9 percentage points), all other coefficients appear to be statistically insignificant at conventional levels. Moreover, we find that individuals with a high level of internal locus of control are significantly more likely to get vaccinated (by 5.3 percentage points) than those with a low level of internal locus of control (Panel C of Table 2). The simpler measure of statistical numeracy based on Lipkus et al. (2001) does not appear to be related to the willingness to get vaccinated (Panel D of Table 2), while for the more demanding test of statistical numeracy we find that respondents who passed the Berlin numeracy test are significantly more willing to get vaccinated (by 5.3 percentage points).

When focusing on the combined model shown in the last four columns of Table 2, we find that most results are similar to the separate models. Yet, the effect of locus of control on vaccination is less pronounced and not statistically significant in the combined model. Instead, the relationship between a high level of neuroticism and unwillingness to get vaccinated becomes slightly larger. One potential explanation is that locus of control and neuroticism are to some extent collinear, as suggested by Judge et al. (2002), who argue that neuroticism and locus of control may be indicators of a common core construct. Indeed, in our data, we find a relatively high and significant negative correlation between the two constructs (r = −0.36, P-value < 0.000).

As our analysis is based on five potential determinants of willingness to get vaccinated, and we are testing five hypotheses, we need to account for multiple hypothesis testing. Thus, we use the Bonferroni correction, which requires a critical P-value of 0.01 for each individual hypothesis to achieve an overall significance level of 5%. Under these more stringent requirements for the significance level, only the association between trait reactance and the willingness to get vaccinated remains consistently significant.

In all our analyses, we control for gender, age and education level of the participants. The effects of these variables on the willingness to get vaccinated appear to be robust across all specifications of our model. As an example, Table A7 shows the estimated coefficients of these covariates when regressing vaccination status on these covariates only. Age is significantly positively correlated with being vaccinated. One additional year is associated with an increase in the vaccination probability by 1.3 percentage points. Given the priority schemes for the distribution of vaccine doses by the German government described in the last section and due to the higher risk for a severe course of the disease among elderly persons, this effect is not surprising. The results related to respondents' gender are not entirely conclusive, as we find that women are less likely to be willing to be vaccinated (4.1 percentage points), but in turn have a slightly but not significantly higher probability of already being vaccinated (3.1 percentage points). In contrast, there are no gender differences in the probabilities of preferring to wait or not wanting to be vaccinated. Lastly, we find that participants with a college degree are significantly more likely to be vaccinated by 8.3 percentage points and significantly less likely to prefer to wait (2.6 percentage points) or being unwilling to get vaccinated (by 2.3 percentage points) compared to those without a college degree.

Comparing the quantitative effect of high trait reactance with that of the education level, which has been shown to be a significant predictor of the willingness to get vaccinated in several studies (cf. Cascini et al., 2021; Humer et al., 2021; Borga et al., 2022), we find that the approximately 9 percentage point lower willingness to get vaccinated in the high trait reactance group is similar in absolute terms to the 8.3 percentage points higher willingness to get vaccinated among study participants with a college degree.

The results regarding the association between trait reactance and vaccination status appear to be robust to several robustness checks. First, we repeat the regressions shown in Table 2 for the different waves of our survey. When performing the same estimations for Waves 2 and 3, which were conducted in July/August and October/November respectively, the results are very similar to those for Wave 1 conducted in May (Tables A12 and A13). This is also true when we estimate the same regression for the total cross-sectional sample of Wave 1 rather than using the sample of those who participated in all three waves (Table A14) as well as when conducting a regression for the pooled sample of all three waves (Table A16). Second, we estimate Probit models for our main estimation sample, where the binary outcome variable equals 1 if a person has already received a vaccination dose and 0 otherwise, or, as an alternative specification, where the binary outcome variable equals 1 if a person is already vaccinated or willing to be vaccinated and 0 otherwise (Table A17). Third, in Tables A8 and A18, we control for an extended set of covariates, including respondents' marital status, employment status, income, and whether children live in the respondents' household.

While we find a strong and statistically significant relationship between the vaccination status and the level of trait reactance throughout all robustness checks, the relations with the other characteristics seem much weaker and less robust. For example, the associations between the willingness to get vaccinated and locus of control as well as performance on the Berlin numeracy test vanish when considering the vaccination status measured in Wave 3 conducted in fall 2021 (see, e.g., Table A13).

To analyse the extent to which our results differ between different population groups, we conduct heterogeneity analyses that consider the main socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents, i.e., age, gender and educational status. To analyse heterogeneity with regard to age, we re-estimate our analysis from Table 2, but distinguish between respondents under 60 years of age and those 60 years or older, the latter being prioritized for the vaccine at the time of the survey in May 2021. The results in Table A23 confirm that the pattern of more reactant people being less likely to be vaccinated is evident in both age groups. In contrast, we find that the relationship between neuroticism, locus of control and statistical numeracy with the willingness to get vaccinated is only visible for participants under the age of 60.

Further, we split the sample by gender (Table A24) and find that the association between trait reactance and vaccination status is visible for men and women. The association between locus of control and the Berlin numeracy test on the one hand and vaccination status on the other hand is visible only for men, while the association with neuroticism is visible only for women. In addition, we differentiate the sample by level of education (Table A25). Here, too, we see that the correlation between trait reactance and vaccination status is evident for respondents with and without a college degree. In contrast, the correlation with locus of control is only visible for the group of respondents without a college degree, while the correlation with neuroticism and the Berlin numeracy test is only visible for respondents with a college degree.

4 Timing of vaccinations
In the survey wave conducted in July and August 2021 (Wave 2), we asked the respondents who were already vaccinated at this point in time (94.6%) about the month in which they received their first vaccination dose. This information allows us to analyse the effects of cognitive and non-cognitive traits on actual vaccination behaviour using an AFT model. The AFT model estimates the hazard function 
 in the following form:
 
(2)
where 
 contains the same factors as in section III and 
 determines the baseline hazard. Individuals who did not get vaccinated by August 2021 are treated as being right-censored.
The AFT model requires distributional assumptions about the baseline hazard but does not rely on the assumption of proportional hazards.10 To decide which distribution function to assume, we fitted a model including covariates to four common distributions: Exponential, Log-Logistic, Log-Normal, and Weibull. According to the resulting Akaike and Bayesian information criterion, the Weibull distribution appears to provide the best fit, and the Log-Logistic distribution the second best fit (Table A9). For our main analyses, we thus decide to rely on the Weibull model. The results of the Log-Logistic model, which differ only slightly from the results of the Weibull model, are reported in Table A20.

Following Allison (2010) and Kleinbaum and Klein (2012a), Figure A1 provides graphical tests of the appropriateness of these two distributional assumptions. These tests rely on the specific properties of the different models. Under the assumption of a Weibull distribution, the log of the survival time 
 should theoretically be in line with 
, where 
 presents the Kaplan–Meier estimate of the survival function. Similarly, under the Log-Logistic distribution, the log of the survival time 
 should be in line with 
. These relationships are plotted in Figure A1, where the dashed line represents a fitted linear regression line along with its 95% confidence interval. Ideally, all values of 
 or 
 respectively, would fall within the confidence interval of the regression line (Allison, 2010). Figure A1 indicates that both models fit the data well, with the Weibull model fitting somewhat better than the Log-Logistic model, as expected based on the information criteria.

Given the Weibull distribution and time-constant covariates, we can simplify the model in equation (2) to a model in which the logarithm of the time until vaccination 
 is a linear function of the covariates (Kroszner and Strahan, 1999; Allison, 2010):
 
 
(3)
where 
 has an extreme value distribution and p is the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution. The parameter vector 
 is directly related to the parameter vector 
 in equation (2) as 
 
 (Kroszner and Strahan, 1999).
The estimation results from the Weibull model in terms of 
 are presented in Table 3. Columns (1)–(5) present regressions in which the different cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics enter separately, while they enter simultaneously in the regression presented in Column (6). Consistent with the empirical results reported in the last section, high trait reactance seems to be strongly related to a later vaccination date (Columns (1) and (6)). This estimate is statistically significant at the 1% level and therefore remains statistically significant when considering simultaneous testing of five hypotheses using the Bonferroni correction with a 5% overall significance level. As the AFT model is estimated in log-linear form, we take the exponential of the parameters to provide a quantitative interpretation. Thus, based on Column (6), the exponential of the coefficient on high trait reactance is 
. Hence, compared to individuals with a low level of trait reactance, the time until vaccination is typically 9% higher for persons with a high level of trait reactance. In contrast, the remaining cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics are not significantly related to vaccination timing.

Notes: The sample is restricted to those respondents who participated in all three waves. Vaccination months were elicited in Wave 2 and the covariates were elicited in Wave 1. Here, we control for age categories rather than continuous age, which is due to the nature of the vaccination prioritization scheme that made the vaccine accessible in a staggered way according to the exact age cutoffs used here to form the age groups. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Number of observations: 2,180.
** and * indicate statistical significance at the 1% and 5% level, respectively.
The coefficients on the covariates suggest that the time until vaccination is around 5% shorter for respondents with a university degree. No significant association is found with regards to the respondents' gender. The dummy variables indicating the age priority groups reveal that older persons exhibit a shorter time until vaccination, as expected due to the prioritization scheme described in section II.

Again, we compare the effect of high trait reactance to the effect of the education level and find that the 9% increase in the duration to first vaccination in the high trait reactance group is about twice as large in absolute terms as the 5% decrease in the duration to first vaccination in the college degree group.

The results assuming a Log-Logistic distribution corroborate the main results from the Weibull model (Table A20). The exception is that in this model, a high internal locus of control seems to be significantly related to a shorter time until vaccination. Yet, this effect becomes non-significant in the combined model (Column (6) of Table A20). This suggests that the results concerning locus of control are less robust than those concerning reactance.

An additional robustness check is presented in Table A21. This robustness check examines the extent of possible time aggregation bias, which arises because the observed vaccination dates are discrete in nature due to the monthly observation rhythm, even though the model assumes continuous data (Petersen, 1991). To assess the sensitivity of our results in this regard, we follow Allison (2010) and recode our data to be interval censored, i.e., rather than assigning respondents a specific month-indicator as the outcome variable, we assign them an interval where the upper interval bound is the month-indicator used before and the lower interval bound is the previous month-indicator plus an epsilon of 0.0001. The latter has the purpose of avoiding zeros for respondents who were vaccinated in the first month observed. Respondents who were not vaccinated at the end of the observation period are assigned an interval that has an open upper interval bound, while the lower interval bound takes the value of the latest observed month. This interval censored data can also be analysed by a Weibull AFT model. The results obtained by using this interval censored model are qualitatively similar to the ones in Table 3 (Table A21). In tendency, the coefficients of the interval censored model are somewhat larger, but there are no changes in the signs or significance of the results.

As a final robustness check, we examine the extent to which the results are driven by individuals who were not yet vaccinated at the time the vaccination dates were elicited and who therefore enter the AFT model as right-censored observations. To do this, we omit these individuals from the estimation sample (Table A22). The signs and significance of the resulting coefficients are similar to the results in Table 3. A high level of trait reactance is still significantly associated with a later vaccination date, although the magnitude of this relationship is smaller than in the model that includes unvaccinated individuals.

5 Putting the results into perspective: trait reactance and vaccination
Our results suggest that trait reactance is the strongest predictor of vaccination behaviour. To put our finding into perspective, we identified nine studies that also investigate the relationship between trait reactance and attitudes towards vaccination (see Table 4 for an overview). These studies support our finding by showing that trait reactance is a predictor of hesitancy to get vaccinated in samples from the USA (Albarracin et al., 2021), Poland (Drażkowski and Trepanowski, 2022), Turkey (Salali et al., 2022), and Finland (Soveri et al., 2023). Compared to our study, which analyses actual vaccination behaviour against Covid-19 at several points in time, the focus of these studies was more on finding out what the hypothetical willingness to get vaccinated was before the vaccines against Covid-19 were available (Drażkowski and Trepanowski, 2022; Soveri et al., 2023), how high the intention to be vaccinated is among those who were not vaccinated at the time of the study, i.e., the self-reported likelihood of being vaccinated in the future (Salali et al., 2022), or it was asked about the willingness to get vaccinated against a hypothetical new disease (Albarracin et al., 2021). Research has also shown that trait reactance not only predicts hesitancy to get vaccinated oneself in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, but also correlates with opinions about childhood vaccination in general prior to the pandemic (Hornsey, Harris, and Fielding, 2018; Finkelstein et al., 2020; Soveri et al., 2020).

Notes: For the outcome variables, higher scores indicate more positive attitudes and beliefs, and higher intentions and probabilities to be vaccinated.
Furthermore, two studies have investigated whether trait reactance moderates the effects of experimental manipulations on attitudes towards vaccination: Albarracin et al. (2021) found that individuals with higher trait reactance do not react differently to mandatory Covid-19 vaccine requirements than individuals with lower trait reactance. By contrast, Soveri et al. (2023) found that requirements to get vaccinated against a hypothetical disease as well as additional information on the vaccine increases the willingness to get vaccinated among individuals with low trait reactance, but not among those with high trait reactance. Neither study found evidence of vaccine requirements backfiring, i.e., vaccine requirements did not reduce the willingness to get vaccinated. The different and therefore puzzling findings of Albarracin et al. (2021) and Soveri et al. (2023) regarding reactance are consistent with the results of Laurin, Kay, and Fitzsimons (2012). Their findings indicate that reactance may be particularly important when rules are not absolute, i.e., when it is not certain whether a rule would come into effect or when a rule is not credibly enforced. By contrast, people tend to rationalize and thus accept rules that are absolute. Consequently, the association between the willingness to get vaccinated and reactance may be weaker under mandatory vaccination. During the Covid-19 pandemic, North Rhine-Westphalia came closest to mandatory vaccination with the so-called ‘2G regulation’, which restricted access to places and events of social life to only those who had been vaccinated or had recovered. This regulation first came into effect on 24 November 2021 (MAGS, 2021), i.e., after Wave 3 was conducted. During our study period, the pressure to get vaccinated was primarily based on non-absolute rules, i.e., on social pressure, public appeals, and increasing hurdles for unvaccinated individuals, e.g., compulsory tests. However, these measures still allowed unvaccinated individuals to participate in social life.

Beyond the topic of vaccination behaviour, it is evident that trait reactance plays a significant role in determining behaviour in aspects of social life. Trait reactance, as operationalized by Hong and Faedda (1996), has been demonstrated to predict real behaviour in multiple domains such as risky sexual activity, drug use (Miller and Quick, 2010), and behaviour in close relationships (Chartrand, Dalton, and Fitzsimons, 2007). Furthermore, it has been shown that reactance moderates the relationship between electronic surveillance and counterproductive behaviour (Yost et al., 2019), between promotional favours and consumer spending (Bertini and Aydinli, 2020), and between hotels' environmental initiatives and consumers' intention to be environmentally conscious (Wang, Krishna, and McFerran, 2017).

To summarize, this section supports two points. First, we note that our results are consistent with previous findings on the relationship between trait reactance and vaccination intentions, which further strengthens our conclusions. Second, we can highlight our contribution to the literature as we observe actual vaccination behaviour against Covid-19 rather than hypothetical behaviour or intentions. Furthermore, we look at different cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics in one study rather than focusing on a single trait.

6 Limitations
This study is subject to limitations that are typical for survey-based correlation studies. These include the possibility that the sample differs from the population in certain observable and unobservable factors. However, as discussed in section II, we expect that the elaborate offline recruitment process of the survey panel from which the respondents were randomly drawn reduces the severity of this problem compared to pure online surveys.

Furthermore, self-reported health measurements are susceptible to various types of reporting bias (see, e.g., Bound, 1991; Kerkhofs and Lindeboom, 1995; Kapteyn, Smith, and van Soest, 2007; Black et al., 2017a; Black, Johnston, and Suziedelyte, 2017b; Davillas, de Oliveira, and Jones, 2023), which may also be the case with our measure of vaccination status. For example, due to the high social pressure and public attention on vaccination against Covid-19 during the study period, self-reports on vaccination status may have been subject to social desirability bias (Wolter et al., 2022). However, we believe such biases to be unlikely to invalidate our results. First, the response options ‘Will get vaccinated as soon as I have the chance’ or ‘Will rather wait’ allow respondents to answer truthfully that they have not yet been vaccinated without directly revealing that they actually do not want to get vaccinated at all. This would mean that we would expect some of those who chose one of these options to be actually not willing to get vaccinated and may only have chosen these options because they are perceived as less socially disapproved of than the option ‘Will not be vaccinated at all’. As a robustness check, we therefore re-estimated our main analyses using a binary dependent variable that takes the value 1 only if someone has already been vaccinated (Table A17), with all three other options coded as 0. The robustness check confirms our results. Additionally, the vaccine was still in short supply, particularly in May 2021, meaning that the majority of Germans had not yet been vaccinated. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that a respondent who was not vaccinated would have felt compelled by social desirability to make a false statement about their vaccination status. Third, the survey was conducted anonymously online, and participants were informed that their information could not be traced back to them. Finally, our main result on trait reactance remains evident when considering the timing of respondents' vaccination, where social desirability or other motivated misreporting is even less likely (Table 3).

Moreover, our results describe the associations between vaccination and the different cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics, rather than causal effects. Ideally, future research can provide causal evidence of the effects of specific characteristics on vaccination behaviour. However, for policy makers and also for society, it might be even more important to build upon the results of our and related studies and try to use knowledge on the predictors of vaccination behaviour to target vaccination campaigns. We show that trait reactance in particular is an important predictor of vaccination behaviour. Individuals with a high level of trait reactance display a significantly lower willingness to get vaccinated.11 Interventions could target especially those with high trait reactance and should, for example, try to overcome perceptions of freedom threat, which may be very pronounced among these individuals (see, for instance, the literature review by Reynolds-Tylus, 2019). Such approaches could be accompanied by scientific research to evaluate the causal effects of targeted interventions, for example by means of randomized controlled field experiments, and to investigate how these effects are moderated by individual differences in trait reactance.

7 Conclusions
Using data obtained from three survey waves of about 2,000 individuals living in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, this paper investigates the association of different cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics with an individuals' willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19 as well as their vaccination status. The empirical results indicate that trait reactance is the strongest predictor of vaccination behaviour. The probability of being vaccinated against Covid-19 is 9 percentage points lower for individuals with a high level of trait reactance, compared to those with a low or medium level of trait reactance. In addition, the time to vaccination is generally 9% higher for such individuals. Furthermore, we find tentative evidence that higher statistical numeracy, a higher internal locus of control, and a more pronounced level of neuroticism are related to vaccination intentions. However, these results are less robust than those regarding trait reactance.

With regard to policy implications, our results indicate that vaccination campaigns and policies could be improved by specifically addressing certain groups of people, in particular those with a high level of trait reactance. To create such targeted measures, we can build on the literature predating the Covid-19 pandemic, which discusses ways to overcome reactance in health communication (see, for instance, the literature review by Reynolds-Tylus, 2019). For example, future vaccination campaigns could use narratives that promote empathy, as Shen (2010) has shown that state empathy can attenuate reactance regarding persuasive messages related to smoking and alcohol use. Moreover, persuasive messages may differ in the extent to which they are perceived as freedom threatening. According to the results of a meta-analysis by Rains (2013), the use of less freedom-threatening language may reduce reactant reactions to such messages.

More generally, by demonstrating that reactance has high explanatory power, and by using an easy-to-implement measure of trait reactance, our study may provide an impetus for using this concept in other behavioural economic studies to explain why some groups are not reached by certain types of interventions. The Covid-19 pandemic was a situation in which the state strongly attempted to influence individual behaviour in the short term. A similar situation arose in the winter of 2022/2023 when Europe experienced an energy shortage due to the war in Ukraine, and European governments urged private households to save as much energy as possible. But even beyond immediate crises, there are many government interventions targeting individual behavioural changes, for example in the areas of preventive health care and retirement savings. In all these situations, reactance can be an important factor limiting the effectiveness of interventions.
