Depth of Contribution Originality and Innovation: Top 5 papers typically address questions of broad, foundational importance or propose groundbreaking methodologies. They often set new standards in the field or open new research avenues. Generalisability: Findings are relevant to a wide range of settings, not just niche contexts. Big Questions: These papers tackle issues with substantial implications for policy, theory, or practice. 2. Methodological Rigour High Standards of Empirical Methods: Empirical papers in Top 5 journals employ state-of-the-art econometric techniques and robust identification strategies (e.g., natural experiments, randomised controlled trials, structural modelling). Theoretical Sophistication: Theoretical contributions are mathematically rigorous and provide deep insights, often with broad applicability. Thorough Robustness Checks: Authors typically provide extensive sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the robustness of their results. 3. Writing and Presentation Quality Clarity and Structure: The narrative is compelling and accessible, even to non-specialists in the subfield, while maintaining academic precision. Polished Presentation: Papers are meticulously written, with clear figures, tables, and appendices. The results are easy to interpret and visually intuitive. Tight Argumentation: Papers avoid unnecessary digressions, focusing directly on the key question and results. 4. Data Quality Novelty of Data: Top 5 papers often leverage unique or hard-to-access datasets that enable the study of questions previously out of reach. Rigorous Cleaning and Documentation: The data handling and analysis process is highly transparent, with all steps carefully documented. 5. Relevance and Impact Policy Relevance: Many Top 5 papers have clear implications for public policy or major economic debates, making their findings influential beyond academia. Cross-Disciplinary Interest: These papers often resonate with researchers in related disciplines, such as political science, sociology, or psychology, enhancing their visibility and citation potential. Citations: Papers in Top 5 journals often become highly cited due to their broad applicability and significance. 6. Extensive Peer Review and Revisions Stringent Referee Process: Top 5 journals have rigorous review processes, often involving multiple rounds of detailed feedback and revisions. High Rejection Rates: Acceptance rates are extremely low (e.g., ~5%), ensuring only the most impactful papers are published. 7. Network Effects and Prestige Author Reputation: Papers by well-known authors or prestigious institutions are more likely to receive attention and scrutiny during the review process. Citations of Existing Literature: Top 5 papers typically build upon or challenge widely recognised works, further cementing their place in prominent scholarly conversations. Comparison with Other Journals Scope and Niche: Non-Top 5 journals may focus on narrower questions or less generalisable findings, which, while still valuable, may not have the same broad impact. Data Availability: Some journals may accept papers using less novel or standard datasets, provided the analysis is sound. Methodological Simplicity: Papers in lower-ranked journals may employ standard or less sophisticated methodologies, especially in empirical studies. Less Competitive Review Process: Non-Top 5 journals generally have higher acceptance rates and shorter review timelines, making them accessible to a broader range of researchers.\",\n        'grant': \"As a reviewer for a major research funding organization, please evaluate whether this research proposal would be competitive for major funding (0 = definitely not fundable, 10 = definitely fundable at the highest award level).\",\n        'top_conference': \"As a program committee member for prestigious economics conferences, please evaluate whether this work would be accepted for presentation (0 = definitely reject, 10 = definitely accept for prominent session).\",\n        'citation_impact': \"Based on the novelty, methodology, and potential influence of this research, please project the actual number of citations this paper will receive in the next 10 years (output should be a specific predicted citation count)\",\n        'research_award': \"As a committee member for major research awards, please evaluate whether this work could be competitive for prestigious recognition (0 = definitely not award-worthy, 10 = definitely award-worthy).\",\n        'nobel_potential': \"As a member of the Nobel Prize Committee for Economic Sciences at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, please provide a realistic evaluation of whether this research publication could contribute to winning the Nobel Prize in Economics (0 = Shows no indication of Nobel Prize potential,10 = Shows definitive Nobel Prize potential)\",\n        'tenure_eval': \"As a senior member of a research university's tenure and promotion committee, please evaluate whether this research portfolio would support a strong case for tenure, considering both the quantity and quality of contributions (0 = definitely deny tenure, 10 = exceptionally strong case for tenure).\"\n        }\n    return prompts.get(property_name)\n\ndef read_full_paper(paper_id):\n    \"\"\"Read the full paper text from file.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        filepath = f\"/work/input/paper_text/{paper_id:03d}.txt\"\n        with open(filepath, 'r') as file:\n            return file.read()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error reading paper {paper_id}: {e}\")\n        return \"\"\n\ndef evaluate_submission(submission_text, paper_id, include_full_text, client, property_name):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate a single submission for a specific property.\"\"\"\n    prompt = get_prompt_for_property(property_name)\n    \n    full_content = submission_text\n    if include_full_text:\n        full_paper = read_full_paper(paper_id)\n        if full_paper:\n            full_content += f\"\\nFull paper: {full_paper}\"\n    \n    try:\n        is_published_check = property_name == 'published'\n        \n        response = client.chat.completions.create(\n            model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n            messages=[\n                {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": prompt},\n                {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": full_content}\n            ],\n            response_format={\n                \"type\": \"json_schema\",\n                \"json_schema\": {\n                    \"name\": \"submission_evaluation\",\n                    \"strict\": True,\n                    \"schema\": {\n                        \"type\": \"object\",\n                        \"properties\": {\n                            \"rating\": {\n                                \"type\": \"number\",\n                                \"description\": f\"Rating for {property_name}\"\n                            }\n                        },\n                        \"required\": [\"rating\"],\n                        \"additionalProperties\": False\n                    }\n                }\n            },\n            temperature=1,\n            max_tokens=2024,\n            top_p=1\n        )\n        \n        result = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)\n        print (result.get('rating'), response.choices[0].message.content)\n        print ('----------------------------------------------------------')\n        return result.get('rating'), response.choices[0].message.content\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"\\nError evaluating submission: {e}\")\n        return None, \"Error\"\n\ndef get_last_processed_index(output_dir, property_name):\n    \"\"\"Get the last processed index from temporary files.\"\"\"\n    temp_files = glob.glob(f\"{output_dir}/{property_name}/{property_name}_temp_*.csv\")\n    if not temp_files:\n        return -1\n    \n    latest_temp = max(temp_files, key=os.path.getctime)\n    try:\n        temp_df = pd.read_csv(latest_temp)\n        #

We distinguish between full or partial sales (one firm gets all or some of the other’s capital) and document several long- and short-run empirical patterns between these variables and the cost of liquidity, as measured by inflation. Quantitatively, the model can match these patterns plus the standard business cycle facts. We also investigate the impact of search frictions, monetary and fiscal policy, persistence in shocks, and returns to scale.\n;\n","output_type":"stream"}],"outputs_reference":"s3:deepnote-cell-outputs-production/8e1ec961-48fa-4a3c-9dad-e4058a8e9808","execution_count":5,"block_group":"f3ce4e4428354f34a732f7d2a4b30059","content_dependencies":null},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":"577892b2","execution_start":1737317999505,"execution_millis":0,"execution_context_id":"36c1de59-e47e-4344-8603-852bfdb0d185","cell_id":"a66368eb943e4b2d850ac5f5dbe73080","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"Blind_submission_df","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":6,"data":{"application/vnd.deepnote.dataframe.v3+json":{"column_count":5,"row_count":30,"columns":[{"name":"Paper_id","dtype":"int64","stats":{"unique_count":30,"nan_count":0,"min":"1","max":"30","histogram":[{"bin_start":1,"bin_end":3.9,"count":3},{"bin_start":3.9,"bin_end":6.8,"count":3},{"bin_start":6.8,"bin_end":9.7,"count":3},{"bin_start":9.7,"bin_end":12.6,"count":3},{"bin_start":12.6,"bin_end":15.5,"count":3},{"bin_start":15.5,"bin_end":18.4,"count":3},{"bin_start":18.4,"bin_end":21.3,"count":3},{"bin_start":21.3,"bin_end":24.2,"count":3},{"bin_start":24.2,"bin_end":27.099999999999998,"count":3},{"bin_start":27.099999999999998,"bin_end":30,"count":3}]}},{"name":"Submission","dtype":"object","stats":{"unique_count":30,"nan_count":0,"categories":[{"name":"A submission with the following details: Title: Endogenous Liquidity and Capital Reallocation; Author: None; Affiliation: None; Abstract: This paper studies economies where firms acquire capital in primary markets and then, after idiosyncratic productivity shocks, retrade it in secondary markets that incorporate bilateral trade with search, bargaining, and liquidity frictions.

Harmonizing all surveys that include father’s occupation and own family income, we develop a mobility measure that allows for the inclusion of nonwhite individuals and women for the 1910s–1970s birth cohorts. We show that mobility increases between the 1910s and 1940s cohorts and that the decline of Black-white income gaps explains about half of this rise. We also find that excluding Black Americans, particularly women, considerably overstates the level of mobility for twentieth-century birth cohorts while simultaneously understating its increase between the 1910s and 1940s.;","Original_Publication":"Journal of Political Economy","Name_Category":"None","Institution":"None","_deepnote_index_column":2},{"Paper_id":6,"Submission":"A submission with the following details: Title: Propagation and Amplification of Local Productivity Spillovers; Author: None; Affiliation: None; Abstract: The gains from agglomeration economies are believed to be highly localized. Using confidential Census plant-level data, we show that large industrial plant openings raise the productivity not only of local plants but also of distant plants hundreds of miles away, which belong to large multi-plant, multi-region firms that are exposed to the local productivity spillover through one of their plants. This “global” productivity spillover does not decay with distance and is stronger if plants are in industries that share knowledge with each other. To quantify the significance of firms' plant-level networks for the propagation and amplification of local productivity shocks, we estimate a quantitative spatial model in which plants of multi-region firms are linked through shared knowledge.

With changing states, societies can be responsive only if agents regularly act upon fresh information, which significantly limits the value of observational learning. When the state is close to persistent, a consensus whereby most agents choose the same action typically emerges. However, the consensus action is not perfectly correlated with the state, because societies exhibit inertia following state changes. When signals are precise enough, learning is incomplete, even if agents draw large samples of past actions, as actions then become too correlated within samples, thereby reducing informativeness and welfare.\n;","Original_Publication":"Econometrica","Name_Category":"None","Institution":"None","_deepnote_index_column":4},{"Paper_id":5,"Submission":"A submission with the following details: Title: Ambiguous Contracts; Author: None; Affiliation: None; Abstract: We explore the deliberate infusion of ambiguity into the design of contracts. We show that when the agent is ambiguity-averse and hence chooses an action that maximizes their minimum utility, the principal can strictly gain from using an ambiguous contract, and this gain can be arbitrarily high. We characterize the structure of optimal ambiguous contracts, showing that ambiguity drives optimal contracts toward simplicity. We also provide a characterization of ambiguity-proof classes of contracts, where the principal cannot gain by infusing ambiguity. Finally, we show that when the agent can engage in mixed actions, the advantages of ambiguous contracts disappear.\n;","Original_Publication":"Econometrica","Name_Category":"None","Institution":"None","_deepnote_index_column":5},{"Paper_id":9,"Submission":"A submission with the following details: Title: Using Divide-and-Conquer to Improve Tax Collection; Author: None; Affiliation: None; Abstract: Tax collection with limited enforcement capacity may be consistent with both high- and low-delinquency regimes: high delinquency reduces the effectiveness of threats, thereby reinforcing high delinquency. We explore the practical challenges of unraveling the high-delinquency equilibrium using a mechanism design insight known as divide-and-conquer. Our preferred mechanism takes the form of prioritized iterative enforcement (PIE). Taxpayers are ranked using the ratio of expected collection to capacity use. Collection threats are issued in small batches to ensure high credibility and induce high compliance. Following repayments, liberated capacity is used to issue the next round of threats. In collaboration with a district of Lima, we experimentally assess PIE in a sample of 13,432 property taxpayers.

I provide empirical evidence that large devaluations are characterized by an increase in the aggregate share of imported inputs in total input spending and by reallocation of resources toward import-intensive firms, contrary to what standard quantitative trade models predict. These facts are explained by the expansion of exporters, which are intense importers. I develop a model where firms globally decide their import and export strategies and discipline it to match salient features of the Mexican micro data. After a devaluation, the model reproduces the pattern of low aggregate substitution and firm reallocation observed in the data. Compared with a benchmark without global firms, the model predicts higher growth of total exports and imports and a …","Original_Publication":"The Quarterly Journal of Economics","Name_Category":"None","Institution":"None","_deepnote_index_column":7},{"Paper_id":7,"Submission":"A submission with the following details: Title: Perceptions About Monetary Policy; Author: None; Affiliation: None; Abstract: We estimate perceptions about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy rule from panel data on professional forecasts of interest rates and macroeconomic conditions. The perceived dependence of the federal funds rate on economic conditions varies substantially over time, in particular over the monetary policy cycle. Forecasters update their perceptions about the Fed’s policy rule in response to monetary policy actions, measured by high-frequency interest rate surprises, suggesting that they have imperfect information about the rule. Monetary policy perceptions matter for monetary transmission, as they affect the sensitivity of interest rates to macroeconomic news, term premia in long-term bonds, and the response of the stock market to monetary policy surprises.

The study uses survival models estimated on a sample of 190 countries over the period 1950M01 to 2022M12. The results show that despite the often-cited issue of the heterogeneity of member countries, monetary unions significantly reduce the duration of HIEs, but not deflation episodes. This result remains robust to a battery of tests and is valid for both developed and developing countries. Furthermore, the results show that giving up monetary sovereignty in favour of an independent common central bank is more effective in terms of price stability than adopting inflation targeting. However, for countries seeking to preserve their monetary sovereignty, inflation targeting remains the best option for reducing the duration of HIEs.

Using a unique panel dataset at the regional level across multiple OECD countries between 2005 and 2020, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in broadband rollout stemming from historical differences in local infrastructure and public policy mandates. We find that increases in broadband penetration lead to shifts in local labor markets, primarily via an increase in high-skill occupations and a decline in routine and low-skill employment. We explore different potential mechanisms behind these changes and present evidence that skill-biased technological change and firm-level organizational innovations both play a role. Our findings suggest that while digitalization offers opportunities for productivity growth and upward mobility, it also risks exacerbating earnings inequality across regions and skill categories, underscoring the importance of targeted public policies to foster inclusive economic growth.;           1\nA submission with the following details: Title: Endogenous Liquidity and Capital Reallocation; Author: Andrei Shleifer; Affiliation: Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Abstract: This paper studies economies where firms acquire capital in primary markets and then, after idiosyncratic productivity shocks, retrade it in secondary markets that incorporate bilateral trade with search, bargaining, and liquidity frictions. We distinguish between full or partial sales (one firm gets all or some of the other’s capital) and document several long- and short-run empirical patterns between these variables and the cost of liquidity, as measured by inflation. Quantitatively, the model can match these patterns plus the standard business cycle facts. We also investigate the impact of search frictions, monetary and fiscal policy, persistence in shocks, and returns to scale.\\n;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\nA submission with the following details: Title: Endogenous Liquidity and Capital Reallocation; Author: Andrei Shleifer; Affiliation: Harvard University; Abstract: This paper studies economies where firms acquire capital in primary markets and then, after idiosyncratic productivity shocks, retrade it in secondary markets that incorporate bilateral trade with search, bargaining, and liquidity frictions.

We develop a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) framework in which households differ in skill levels, wealth, and labor force attachment. Our model introduces search-and-matching frictions in the labor market and accommodates incomplete asset markets, thereby capturing the ways in which aggregate shocks have unequal effects on households. We calibrate the model to United States data and estimate that expansionary monetary policy, while boosting average output and employment, magnifies income disparities under certain conditions of labor market stickiness. Targeted transfers and labor market reforms that reduce matching frictions mitigate this adverse distributional effect. Our results suggest that policymakers should consider inequality implications when designing monetary policy, highlighting the importance of coordination between monetary and labor market policies.\\n;               1\nA submission with the following details: Title: Monetary Shocks, Labor Market Frictions, and Income Inequality: A Heterogeneous Agents Approach; Author: Tabitha J.
