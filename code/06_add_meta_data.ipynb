whether risk disclosure practices and corporate governance mechanisms are associated with the performance of listed companies in Malaysia’s emerging economy. The study uses fixed effects panel data regression models to gauge the relationship using 899 firm-year observations from companies that provide risk disclosures in their annual reports. The findings show that risk disclosure has a significant effect on firm performance. Audit committee monitoring also has a significant relationship with firm performance, while the results regarding the existence of a risk management committee are insignificant. In additional analyses, a composite measure of audit committee effectiveness confirms that its monitoring role improves firm performance significantly. This study addresses risk disclosure practi…","Original_Publication":"Asian Economic and Financial Review (AEFR)","Name_Category":"Retracted Name","Institution":"Retracted Institution","top5_desk_1":6,"top5_desk_2":8,"top5_desk_3":7,"top5_desk_mean":7,"top5_accept_1":8,"top5_accept_2":6,"top5_accept_3":8,"top5_accept_mean":7.33,"top5_accept_rating_1":3,"top5_accept_rating_2":3,"top5_accept_rating_3":3,"top5_accept_rating_mean":3,"top5_accept_rating_criteria_1":3,"top5_accept_rating_criteria_2":3,"top5_accept_rating_criteria_3":3,"top5_accept_rating_criteria_mean":3,"top_conference_1":8,"top_conference_2":8,"top_conference_3":7,"top_conference_mean":7.67,"tenure_eval_1":8,"tenure_eval_2":8,"tenure_eval_3":9,"tenure_eval_mean":8.33,"research_award_1":8,"research_award_2":7,"research_award_3":7,"research_award_mean":7.33,"nobel_potential_1":5,"nobel_potential_2":5,"nobel_potential_3":5,"nobel_potential_mean":5,"grant_1":7,"grant_2":8,"grant_3":8,"grant_mean":7.67,"citation_impact_1":75,"citation_impact_2":75,"citation_impact_3":120,"citation_impact_mean":90,"Author":"None","gender":"Retracted Name","gender_name_category":"Retracted Name","pub_quality":"Low","pub_quality_numeric":2,"_deepnote_index_column":9020},{"Submission_id":"S_009022","Paper_id":22,"Submission":"A submission with the following details: Title: Microeconomic Marvels Understanding Small-scale Markets;

On the other side, both are some key aspects of combat performance. Operational psychology is focused on using psychological knowledge in enhancing operational performance. First is necessary to understand their nature and relationship, in the direction of making strategies for training and dealing. Stress is productive when is optimal, while decision making process has its specifics in dynamic and risk contexts.

Topics like flow shop and parallel machine models are traditionally discussed in an Industrial Engineering class. However, we discussed these topics successfully in a fashion management class by providing examples that our students could relate to. This included examples in apparel production and fashion retailing. The students were also able to learn several logical Excel based formulas while creating spreadsheets for these topics. For the flow shop model, we create a spreadsheet model that reflects all details of the Gantt chart including idle times. In the case of parallel machines, the spreadsheet involves the more complex Nested IF functions.

We randomly assigned monthly transfers to a representative sample of working-age adults over a period of twelve months. Leveraging experimental variation, we estimate the causal impact of TUBI on labor supply, job search, and overall household wellbeing.

We develop a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) framework in which households differ in skill levels, wealth, and labor force attachment. Our model introduces search-and-matching frictions in the labor market and accommodates incomplete asset markets, thereby capturing the ways in which aggregate shocks have unequal effects on households. We calibrate the model to United States data and estimate that expansionary monetary policy, while boosting average output and employment, magnifies income disparities under certain conditions of labor market stickiness.

Using a unique panel dataset at the regional level across multiple OECD countries between 2005 and 2020, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in broadband rollout stemming from historical differences in local infrastructure and public policy mandates. We find that increases in broadband penetration lead to shifts in local labor markets, primarily via an increase in high-skill occupations and a decline in routine and low-skill employment. We explore different potential mechanisms behind these changes and present evidence that skill-biased technological change and firm-level organizational innovations both play a role.
