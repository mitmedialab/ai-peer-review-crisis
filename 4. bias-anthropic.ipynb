Abstract This study investigates whether the capital adequacy framework with two capital ratios affects the liquidity creation (LC) of a bank by using 18,247 commercial banks from 1996 to 2016. Different from studies that use a single capital ratio to proxy capital adequacy, we follow the spirit of Basel III by using a novel combination of two capital ratios to classify strong and weak capital adequate banks. Thus, we can examine the effectiveness of our capital adequacy framework. We then propose that a weak capital adequate bank is less cautious of risk, whereas a strong capital adequate bank is prudent of risk. The former cre- ates more liquidity and has a negative correlation between capital and LC, which is consist- ent with the financial fragility view, whereas the latter shows the opposite, which follows the risk-absorption view.   *\\n1IntroductionOneoftheprimaryfunctionsofbanksistocreateliquiditythroughdepositsorotherliabilitiestofacilitatelending(DiamondDybvig1983;Kashyap2002).Whenthisliquiditycreation(LC)mismatcheslong-termassetswithshort-termliabilities,itcanexposebankstoilliquidityrisk—theriskofhavingtodisposeofilliquidassetstomeetcustomers’liquiditydemands(DiamondDybvig1983;AllenSantomero1997;AllenGale2004;DiamondRajan2011;Zheng2019).CaseslikeNorthernRock’sWashingtonMutual’sfinancialdifficultiesduetotheirpoorliquiditymanage-mentduringthe2008financialcrisishighlightedthecriticalimportanceofliquidityrisk.Thisriskistypicallyconsideredtoberelatedtobankcapital.Dermine(2015)Acosta-Smith(2019)arguethatliquidityriskarisingfrommaturitymismatchinsufficientliquidityholdingscanleadtobankrunsevenliquidation.However,increasingcapitalcanmitigateliquidityriskbyencouragingactionssuchasholdingmoreliquidassets.Toincreasebanksoundnessforabetterriskcontrol,modifiedthetraditionalcapitaladequacyframeworkbyaddinganon-risk-basedleverageratiotosupplementtherisk-basedcapitalratiointroducedliquidityrequirements.1Thisregulatoryshiftnecessitatedthere-examinationoftherelationshipbetweencapitalLC,astherevisedcapitaladequacyframeworkthatconsiderstwocapitalratiosratherthanasingleonemaycomplicatethisrelationship.How-ever,veryfewstudiesinvestigatethisrelationshipfromthisperspective.ThisstudyexaminestheeffectsofthecapitaladequacyframeworkonLChowitinfluencestherelationshipbetweencapitalLC.Similartotherevisedcapitaladequacyframework,ourcapitaladequacyframeworkalsoconsiderstwocapitalratios.Wethuscombinethefollowingtwocapitalratiostodefineourstrongweakcapitalade-quatebanks.Oneistherisk-basedcapitalratio(CAR),definedasthetotalregulatorycapitaloverrisk-weightedassets(RWAs)whichhasbeenenforcedsinceof1988.Theotheris,definedastheratioofequitytototalassets(TAs).Itsconceptissimilarto’sleverageratio,whichalsousesnon-risk-weightedassets,representedbythetotalvalueofon-off-balancesheetactivities,asthedenominator.2Thus,theCARLRprovidecomplementaryperspectiveswhenevalu-atingabank’srisk-takingbehaviors.Whilemoststudiesexamineoneortheother,wecon-siderboththatisamorecomprehensiveassessment.Accordingly,wedefineabankasbeing“strongcapitaladequate”whenitiswell-capitalizedtermsoftheCARtheLRabove10%5%,respectively(PeekRosengren1997;Perkins2019).Inmanycases,however,thetwocapitalratiosmoveoppositedirections,leadingtodebatesaboutthetruecapitaladequacyofabank.Forexample,wereconsideredthebest-capitalizedbanksbasedontheirhighCARs2006,buttheirlowLRsleftthemvulnerableduringthe2008financialcrisis(Hildebr2008).3Inthiscase,theregulatoryCARfailedtoaccuratelyidentifythetruecapitalizationofthebanks,which1Thestrengtheneditsliquidityframeworkbydeveloping.2Thenon-risk-basedleverageratioWealsouse.Wedonotuse3In2006,CreditSuissehadaCARof16.5%,Tier1CARof11.4%,theratioofequitytototalassetsof2.123%;hadaCARof14.7%,Tier1CARof11.9%,ratioofequitytototalassetsof2.073%.\\nCapital and liquidity creation: does the capital adequacy… were not well-capitalized despite their appearances. Some studies suggest that banks may manipulate their RWAs that leads to the underestimation of their risk (Mariathasan and Merrouche 2014). Therefore, they may carry excessive risk, which cannot be adequately captured by CAR alone. Combining the LR with the CAR as a complementary measure provides a check on whether a bank has excessive risk through its capital provision for both RWAs and total assets. Following this perspective, we define a bank as being “weak capital adequate” when it is well-capitalized in terms of the CAR above 10% but poorly- capitalized in terms of the LR below 5%. We argue that the strength of banks’ capital adequacy may reflect their varied risk atti- tudes. We refrain from combining the CAR and LR into a single ratio, that is, RWA density as some studies use to represent a bank’s risk-taking level,4 because RWA density only considers the denominators of the two capital ratios and because the RWA may be sub- ject to manipulation.5 Considering the level of capital provision against the risky and total assets better reflects the bank’s risk attitudes, which aligns with the spirit of Basel Accords regarding capital adequacy. Therefore, we posit that a strong capital adequate bank is more cautious of risk than a weak capital adequate bank because the former is willing to pre- pare sufficient capital to cover the potential losses from the RWA and TA, while the latter only prepares capital against the loss from the RWA. When most banks meet the CAR requirements, whether they maintain adequate capital in the unenforced leverage ratios also reflects their attitudes toward risk. Studies suggest that a bank with a low leverage ratio tends to take excessive risks due to higher moral hazards and information asymmetries (Jensen 1986; Berger 1995); conversely, higher capital reduces risk-taking incentives (Fur- long and Keeley 1989; Konishi and Yasuda 2004) or solvency risk (Diamond and Rajan 2000, 2001; Cornett et al. 2011; Allen et al. 2015; Hugonnier and Morellec 2017; Kapan and Minoiu 2018). We propose two hypotheses. First, the weak capital adequate bank creates more liquid- ity than a strong capital adequate bank (H1). Second, the weak capital adequate bank has a negative relationship between capital and liquidity, while the strong capital adequate one has a positive relationship between capital and liquidity (H2). We adopt Berger and Bou- wman’s (2009) LC measure that emphasizes the liquidity transformation in which banks fund long-term illiquid assets with short-term liquid liabilities. The reasoning behind the two hypotheses is as follows: Given our presumption that a strong capital adequate bank is more cautious of risk than a weak capital adequate bank, the latter will create more liquidity than the former, that is, H1. To explain H2, we draw on the views of risk absorption and financial fragility in the literature. We argue that the risk- absorption view applies to a strong capital adequate bank. Its cautious attitude toward risk leads it to take more risk when it has sufficient capital to absorb the loss. Accordingly, for this bank, a higher capital enables it to create more liquidity because it equips a bank with greater ability to absorb risk (Allen and Santomero 1997; Berger and Bouwman 2009). In contrast, the financial fragility view explains the negative capital and LC link for banks with weaker capital adequacy. A weak capital adequate bank tends to be less cautious about risk, leading it to create more liquidity despite having less capital to absorb losses. Studies 4 The RWA density is the ratio of the denominator of the CAR to that of the LR. That is, the ratio of RWA to TA (Bitar et al. 2018; Acosta-Smith et al. 2024). 5 It is argued that the RWA would be manipulated by adopting the IRB approach, securitizations, various accounting choices, and other complex practical methods (Blum 2008; Mariathasan and Merrouche 2014).\\nM.-W. Wu et al. indicate that a bank with a fragile capital structure is prone to severe agency problems, one of which is the conflict between shareholders and creditors. This can lead to risk shifting from shareholders to depositors, which in turn increases the bank’s risk-taking incentive (Shrieves and Dahl 1992; Berger et al. 1995; VanHoose 2007; Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2013; Duran and Lozano-Vivas 2014). Thus, a bank with a fragile capital structure tends to take more risks. Simultaneously, such a bank with a lower capital structure relies on more deposits as primary funding. To attract deposits, the bank would adopt a fragile financial structure with a significant proportion of liquid deposit. This is because a bank has an informational advantage in the lending and is tempted to extract rents from depositors by demanding more loan income, and if depositors refuse these extractions, the bank may threaten to reduce its monitoring or loan collection efforts. Thus, adopting the fragile financial structure alleviates depositors’ concerns about the bank potentially abusing their trust by allowing depositors to use the threat of bank runs to prevent the bank from creating hold-up problems. Accordingly, this structure attracts more liquid deposit funding, enabling the bank to create more liquidity (Diamond and Rajan 2000; Berger and Bouwman 2009; Horváth et al. 2014).6 To summa- rize, the fragile capital structure enables our weak capital adequate bank to assume more risk in liquidity creation. However, as increased capital alleviates a bank’s agency problems, thus curbing its risk taking; it also reduces financial fragility by shifting the bank’s reliance from attracting liquid deposits to maintaining a stable capital base, which diminishes the bank’s efforts to compete for deposits and affects traditional liquidity sources. Thus, an increased capital of a bank reduces its liquidity creation.7 However, the high leverage characteristic of our weak capital adequate bank indicates a minimal inclination to significantly increase bank capital, resulting in only a marginal reduction in liquidity creation. We use global data from 18,247 commercial banks in 36 OECD countries from 1996 to 2016 for our main results.8 The overall sample depicts whether our two hypotheses can be generalized globally rather than be applicable to only a few countries or even a single coun- try. To minimize the unobserved time-invariant country heteroskedasticity that may cause inefficiency and may create the problem of an omitted third variable, we control country characteristics, such as the regulatory stringency on capital (Distinguin et al. 2013) and bank activities (Shen and Chang 2006). In the robustness tests, we narrow the sample to certain countries in the same geographic regions or to those could determine their lever- age ratios based on market mechanisms and did not impose minimum requirements for the leverage ratio before Basel III. Five things are worth to be noted. First, weak capital adequate banks make up a small proportion but are still worth investigating because they may adversely affect all banks through their highly interconnected activities; thus, if they are in distress, they may threaten financial stability.9 The situation will be even worse when they are large, as this could trigger the too-big-to-fail problem. Second, we exclude banks with undercapital- ized CAR because some of their activities of LC may be distorted by the restrictions from regulators, such as the prompt corrective action (PCA) in the US, or they may face lower 6 Berger and Bouwman (2009) refer to this argument as the financial fragility/crowding-out hypothesis. 7 We thank the anonymous reviewer’s comment and suggestion that help us clarify this viewpoint. 8 Due to information asymmetry or higher bargaining power of banks, the hold-up problem, e.g., banks conduct rent extraction from depositors by demanding a greater share of loan income, exists in the banking sector. 9 Northern Rock was fully compliant with CAR (11.6%), but its LR was only 3% in 2006, shortly before it failed in 2007. Dexia had a high CAR of up to 14.7% in 2010, almost twice as much as the regulatory requirement, but its LR was only 1.9% in 2010. As shown in Panel B of Table 1, the weak capital adequate banks comprised more than 10% of all banks before the 2008 crisis and approximately 7% after the crisis.\\nCapital and liquidity creation: does the capital adequacy… competition in raising funding than the strong capital adequate and weak capital adequate banks. Third, our sample was collected before the formal implementation of Basel III, in which the CAR has been mandatorily implemented, but the LR is a discretionary require- ment for banks in most countries.10 Thus, the sample of the two types of banks is suitable to provide an experimental environment for examining the effects of strong and weak capi- tal adequacy. Fourth, we use the official standards of capital adequacy for CAR and LR, rather than using arbitrary criteria, to define banks with strong and weak capital adequacy. Fifth, we focus on the correlation between capital and LC rather than causality because capital and LC may be jointly determined. Berger and Bouwman (2009) and Bonner and Hilbers (2015) claim that the capital and LC are correlational in practice. In the robustness tests, we use Heckman’s (1978) two-stage regression to minimize self-selection bias and the instrumental variable approach to mitigate the endogeneity concern. Our findings support the H1 and H2. A weak capital adequate bank creates more liquid- ity than a strong capital adequate bank and has a negative relationship between capital and liquidity, while the strong capital adequate one has the opposite results. These results hold across our seven robustness tests such as considering bank size, the endogeneity problem, country heteroskedasticity, alternative cutoffs for being well-capitalization, alternative defi- nitions of LR, the announcement of Basel III’s LR requirement, and differences in deposit insurance coverage.11 We additionally compare our capital adequacy framework that includes CAR and LR with the traditional capital adequacy framework with CAR alone and find that our strong capital adequate banks create less liquidity and have a positive cap- ital–LC link (see Table 5), whereas capital adequate banks under the traditional framework show the opposite results (see Appendix I).12 Our study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, unlike studies that consider one capital ratio,13 our approach integrates both the CAR and LR, which better aligns with the spirit of Basel III, examines the effect of our capital adequacy framework. Second, we classify banks by our capital adequacy framework, while past studies typically classify banks in terms of asset sizes (Berger and Bouwman 2009; Distinguin et al. 2013; DeYoung et al. 2018), eco- nomic conditions (Berger and Bouwman 2013; Sorokina et al. 2017), or levels of globalization (Bonner and Hilbers 2015). We provide evidence that the two types of banks classified by our capital adequacy framework exhibit significant differences in liquidity creation, suggesting the framework’s effectiveness. Third, we provide an economic explanation that banks with strong and weak capital adequacies may have different relationships with the capital and LC due to 10 We discuss capital regulation of our sample countries in Appendix IV. 11 The first one is to consider the effect of size (Berger and Bouwman 2009; Distinguin et al. 2013). We examine the effects of our two capital adequacies in big and non-big banks. The second one is to minimize the endogeneity by using Heckman’s (1978) two-stage regression and the instrumental variable approach. The third robustness test is to reduce country heteroskedasticity by using samples in the same geographic regions or with similar capital regulatory regimes. Fourth, we use alternative cutoffs for being well-capital- ized, 8% and 4%, for the CAR and the LR rather than 10% and 5% in the baseline model, respectively. Fifth, we use an alternative definition of the LR to examine our issue: the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets that various studies have also used (Evanoff and Wall 2001; Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2013; Lubberink 2014). Sixth, we investigate the effect of the announcement of Basel III’s LR requirement on the relationship between capital and LC. Lastly, differences in deposit insurance coverage across the 36 OECD countries are also taken into account. 12 The strong capital adequate banks under our capital adequacy framework are banks with CAR above 10% and LR above 5%. The capital adequate banks under traditional capital adequacy framework are banks with CAR above 10%. 13 Demirguc-Kunt et al. (2013), Abou-El-Sood (2016), and Bitar et al. (2018) investigate the effect of CAR, while Berger and Bouwman (2013), Demirguc-Kunt et al. (2013), and Hogan et al. (2018) focus on LR.\\nM.-W. Wu et al. their different attitudes toward risks. We use the views of risk absorption and financial fragility to explain the economic behavior of the two types of banks that could help regulators in for- mulating detailed capital requirement policies. The remainder of this study is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we review the literature on capital adequacy and liquidity creation and discuss definitions and characteristics of our weak and strong capital adequate banks. Section 3 presents the empirical model, and Sect. 4 offers the data descriptions. In Sect. 5, we discuss the main results. Section 6 presents the robustness tests, while Sect. 7 concludes. 2 \\x07Literature review and definitions 2.1 \\x07Literature review on the relationship between capital and liquidity creation Theoretical studies have explained the relationship between capital and liquidity from different perspectives. Studies concerning the positive relationship are generally from the view of risk absorption, which shows that banks with more capital would create more liquidity because more capital could absorb risk and expand banks’ risk-bearing capacity (Bhattacharya and Thakor 1993; Repullo 2004; Von Thadden 2004; Coval and Thakor 2005). Berger and Bou- wman (2009) call this the risk-absorption hypothesis. Similarly, Calem and Rob’s (1999) theoretical argument shows that a bank with sufficient capital will take more risk to benefit from the upside because they believe more capital keeps the insolvency remote. Barth and Seckinger (2018) argue that increasing non-risk-weighted capital requirements not only miti- gates moral hazard but can also have a negative allocating effect, especially for a bank that has low monitoring skill but a risky investment project. Gupta et al. (2023) also corroborate this U-shaped bi-directional relationship between capital and LC in the Asia Pacific region. In contrast, the discussions about the negative relationship begin with the fragile finan- cial structure could be deduced as follows. Some studies focus on fragile capital struc- tures and bank risk-taking. Jensen and Meckling (1976) argue that the agency cost of debt increases with the firm’s level of leverage that exacerbates shareholders’ incentives to take risks (Green and Talmor 1986). Banks with low capital may induce an asset-substitution moral hazard by choosing excessively risky or socially inefficient portfolios (Merton 1977; Bhattacharya et al. 1998; Calem and Rob 1999; Thakor 2014; Acharya et al. 2016). In short, banks with fragile capital structures are more likely to take on greater risks.14 How- ever, Diamond and Rajan (2000, 2001) focus on depositors and argue that deposit con- tracts allow them to threaten banks with runs in the event of a hold-up problem through deposit contracts, thereby mitigating that issue and maximizing LC, particularly when deposit insurance coverage is incomplete. Therefore, to attract deposits, a bank would adopt a fragile financial structure with a large share of liquid deposit contracts (Horváth et al. 2014). Gorton and Winton (2017) show that since deposits are liquid and bank equity is illiquid, a higher capital ratio may reduce liquidity creation through the crowding out of deposits. Similar discussions are shown in other studies (Merton 1977; Green and Tal- mor 1986; Bhattacharya and Thakor 1993; Allen and Santomero 1997; Bhattacharya et al. 14 Few studies provide other explanations. For example, Acosta-Smith et al. (2019) describe the positive relation by the “liquidity-demand” effect that a higher capital ratio means that banks have a more stable liability structure, which in turn implies a lower need for liquidity holdings, and so induces banks to hold less liquid assets and argue the negative relation by the “skin-in-the-game” effect that a higher capital ratio leads to a higher cost of early liquidation due to insufficient liquidity holdings.\\nCapital and liquidity creation: does the capital adequacy… 1998; Diamond and Rajan 2001; Repullo 2004; Von Thadden 2004; Coval and Thakor 2005; Berger and Bouwman 2009; Thakor 2014; Acharya et al. 2016; Gorton and Win- ton 2017). Berger and Bouwman (2009) refer to this as the financial fragility/crowding-out hypothesis. However, empirical studies find mixed results in the relationship. By using banks in differ- ent areas, some studies find a negative relationship between capital and LC in such as Czechia (Horváth et al. 2014), the UK (Acosta-Smith et al. 2019), the US (Niu 2023), Germany (Berger et al. 2016), China (Lei and Song 2013), and the European area (Distinguin et al. 2013; Roulet 2018). By using the ratio of equity to TAs as a proxy for capital, Huang et al. (2018) find a pos- itive relationship between capital and LC regardless of capital level, while Casu et al. (2019) find a negative relationship between LC and a high capital level. Furthermore, some argue that the relationship varies with different conditions, such as bank sizes (Berger and Bouwman 2009; Distinguin et al. 2013; DeYoung et al. 2018), market and economic conditions (Berger and Bouwman 2013; Sorokina et al. 2017), regulatory interventions (Berger et al. 2016; Evans and Haq 2022), and local or international banks (Bonner and Hilbers 2015). 2.2 \\x07Weak capital adequate and strong capital adequate banks We classify banks as either strong or weak capital adequate by jointly considering their levels of CAR and LR. A weak capital adequate bank has high CAR and low LR. Thus, we must determine the thresholds to separate high and low CAR and LR. Given that other studies do not offer cutoffs to classify them, we select the cutoffs according to official requirements. We use either 8% or 10% as a criterion for CAR. We choose 8%, because it is the mini- mum regulatory capital ratio in Basel I and Basel II. We choose 10%, because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991 identifies any institu- tion as well-capitalized if it has a total CAR of 10% or higher. Moreover, we use either 4% or 5% as a criterion for LR when Basel I and Basel II do not stipulate well-capitalized banks based on LR. We choose 4% because US banking agencies estimate that the crite- rion of Basel III for a leverage ratio is roughly equivalent to a US leverage ratio of 4.3% (Department of Treasury, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corpo- ration, 2013). We also choose 5%, because we borrow the criterion of LR based on FDI- CIA of 1991, which uses 5% to define a well-capitalized bank.15 Other countries recently raised their minimum leverage ratio requirement from 3% to 5%.16 15 The history of the minimum LR requirement in the US is as follows. In 1981, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) developed guidelines and revisions for the bank capi- tal ratio. The guidelines indicated the minimum primary capital-to-total assets ratio for regional banking organizations to be 5%, and the minimum for community banks to be 6%. In June 1983, regulators revised the guidelines for multinational organizations to meet the 5% minimum primary capital-to-total assets ratio. In 1985, the FDIC and OCC announced a uniform 5.5% for the primary capital-to-total assets ratio of capi- tal (essentially equity and loan-loss reserves) to total assets for all banking organizations regardless of size. They then moved to a combination of risk-based and leverage capital ratios in 1988–1992. In 1991 and 1992, these regulators replaced the primary capital ratio with the ratio of Tier 1 equity to total assets and developed five categories of capitalization with 5% for LR and 10% for the risk-based capital ratio as the criteria for a well-capitalized bank under Sect. 131 in FDICIA of 1991 (Alfriend 1988; Wall 1989; Davison 1997; Aggarwal and Jacques 1998, 2001). 16 For example, separately from Basel III, the US proposed an “enhanced supplementary leverage ratio,” whereby its threshold should be at least 5% in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discre- tionary bonus payments. The leverage ratio requirement in Switzerland consists of a minimum requirement of 3%. For the two global systemically important Swiss banks, Credit Suisse and UBS, this translates into\\nWe hence have two sets of critical values ((8%, 4%) and (10%, 5%)) to examine the robustness of our results. For simplicity, we describe our testing approach using the second set of critical values, that is, a weak capital adequate bank has CAR that exceeds 10% and LR that below 5%. By contrast, a strong capital adequate bank has CAR that is above 10% and LR that is above 5%. 2.3 \\x07Liquidity creation (LC) Berger and Bouwman (2009) recommend category and maturity classifications to calculate a bank’s LC. We use the category classification because of data availability on global sam- ples. Following their approach, we calculate LC via a three-step procedure. First, we divide all assets, liabilities, and equities into liquid, semiliquid, and illiquid items based on their categorized activities. This classification is applied to all the assets, liabilities, equity, and off-balance sheet activities of a bank. Second, we integrate the concept of weight into the categorization from the first step. We follow Berger and Bouwman (2009) and assign the values of ½, 0, and –½ as the weights of liquid, semiliquid, and illiquid liabilities, respec- tively. Third, we combine the categorized activities and weights by following the two pre- vious steps as they apply to the LC. Accordingly, we define LC as: LC = [½ × Illiquid Assets + 0 × Semiliquid Assets + ( −½) × Liquid Assets + ½ × Liquid Liabilities + 0 × Semiliquid Liabilities + ( −½) × (Illiquid Liabilities + Equity) + ½ × Illiquid Activities + 0 × Semiliquid Activities + ( −½) × Liquid Activities]/Total Assets. Appendix III presents our category classifications of accounting items based on their liquidity contexts. 2.4 \\x07Distribution and characteristics of strong and weak capital adequate banks Using the sample defined in Sect. 4, we tabulate the distribution of strong and weak capital adequate banks in different samples and periods in Table 1 and 36 countries in Table 2. Table 3 lists the univariate statistics of characteristics of strong and weak capital adequate banks. We additionally provide official capital regulations and bank and country charac- teristics from the literature in Appendix IV, which may support the results in these tables. Table 1 presents the bank-year observations for all banks and for strong and weak capital adequate banks with percentages in parentheses. In Panel A, using the whole sample, we find that the percentage of strong capital adequate banks is much higher than that of weak capital adequate banks. We also note that the percentage of weak capital adequate banks slightly drops from 1.68% before the 2008 crisis to 1.13% after the 2008 crisis. This finding may partly reflect the changes in attitude toward capital at some banks in response to the official intention to tighten capital during the crisis outbreak. We exclude banks in the US, Canada, and Switzerland in Panel B because these countries implemented the regulation of a minimum LR ratio during the sample period of this study. However, in our regression, we consider samples with and without these three countries to check for robustness.17 In the whole period, the number (percentage) of observations of weak capital adequate banks 17 The aggregate percentage of weak capital adequate banks becomes 1.48% if we consider these three countries. However, the aggregate percentage is approximately 10% (9.30%) when excluding them. 5%. All Norwegian banks have been subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement of 5% since 2017.\\nCapital and liquidity creation: does the capital adequacy… (CAR≧10%, LR < 5%) is 3,786 (9.30%). Thus, a weak capital adequate bank is not rare. In contrast, the number (percentage) of strong capital adequate banks is 34,826 (85.51%). In the period before the 2008 global crisis, the numbers (percentages) of weak and strong capital adequate banks are 2,753 (10.49%) and 21,991 (83.76%), respectively. By contrast, after this crisis, the two types of banks are 1,033 (7.14%) and 12,835 (88.69%), respectively. Hence, the percentage of weak capital adequate banks is higher before than after the crisis. The percentages of banks with CAR < 10% are 5.76% and 4.17% during the pre- and post-crisis periods, respectively. This finding is not surprising because banks only needed to meet the well-capitalized requirement of 8% before the 2008 crisis. However, regulators explicitly or implicitly required them to meet a well-capitalized requirement of 10% during the 2008 crisis. Table 2 presents the number and percentage of different types of banks in 36 countries during the whole sample period. We divide countries into five regions: Western Europe, Non-Western Europe, America, Asia, and Oceania. The countries with more than 10% of weak capital adequate banks are Austria (12.06%), Belgium (12.52%), France (11.82%), Germany (12.39%), Ireland (10.73%), Luxembourg (24.78%), Netherlands (10.62%), and Japan (16.80%). The first seven countries are in Western Europe, while Japan has the high- est percentage of weak capital adequate banks in Asia. Fukao (2003) finds that most Japa- nese banks have CAR above 10% but have low LR, because they often use historical cost bookkeeping of equity portfolios, under-reserving against bad loans, and subordinated debts from friendly life-insurance companies to raise BIS ratios. Finally, the percentages Table 1 The numbers of observations (percentages) of strong capital adequate banks, weak capital adequate banks, and other banks This table presents the numbers of observations (percentages in parentheses) of strong capital adequate, weak capital adequate, and other banks before and after the 2008 global financial crisis.

The results are consistent with our two hypoth- eses. First, weak capital adequate banks have a higher average LC ($0.505 billion) than strong capital adequate banks ($0.354 billion), and the difference is significant at the 1% level. The results support H1. Second, weak capital adequate banks have a lower average CAR (13.297%) than strong capital adequate banks (16.847%), and the difference is sig- nificant at the 1% level. These results may present indirect evidence that supports H2, as weak capital adequate banks have low CAR and high LC. We also find a similar pattern when LR represents the capital ratio. Thus, the weak capital adequate bank is less cautious over risk versus the strong capital adequate bank. For other bank characteristics and institutional and macroeconomic variables, weak cap- ital adequate banks have a higher natural logarithmic transformation of total assets (lnTA), a lower return on assets (ROA) and dividend payout ratio (DPR), and a higher nonper- forming loans ratio (NPLr), cost-to-income ratio (CostInc), and income tax rate (ITR) than strong capital adequate banks. The large size of the weak capital adequate banks serves as evidence that financial stability is heavily impacted when this type of bank is in distress. Moreover, weak capital adequate banks are mostly located in countries with high market concentration (Conc), low supervision of capital regulation (Cap_Reg), few restrictions on bank activities (Restrict), and a low growth rate of real GDP (GDPg). However, we do not find any significant difference in deposit insurance coverage limit (CovLim) between the two types of banks.19 3 \\x07Empirical design We use a model similar to Berger and Bouwman’s (2009) that focuses on the correlation between capital and LC but not their causality. We use lagged capital ratios, dummies for strong and weak capital adequate banks, and their interactions to study the LC and the capital and LC linkage in the strong and weak capital adequate banks. We use the fixed effects model to control for average differences in LC across banks and years to provide the baseline results. We further minimize the self-selection bias and endogenous capital ratios by using Heckman’s (1978) two-stage regression and the instrumental variables in a two- stage least squares (2SLS) regression for robustness tests, respectively. Our model is: 18 The other banks are those with CAR below 10%. The average percentages of the number of other banks in the countries of Western Europe, Non-Western Europe, and Oceania are 1.01%, 4.02%, and 0.91%, respectively, which are lower than those of strong capital adequate and weak capital adequate banks in the same geographic areas. Surprisingly, the average percentages for other banks in American and Asian coun- tries are not the lowest. One possible explanation is that these banks in Israel, Japan, and the United States comprise much higher ratios, at 10.69%, 30.58%, and 0.64%, respectively. 19 The other banks have CAR below 10%. Comparing strong capital adequate banks and weak capital ade- quate banks, these banks have the least number of observations, lowest ROA, highest NPL ratio, highest cost-to-income ratio, lowest income tax rate, and lowest dividend payout ratio. Their asset size and liquidity creation are in the middle of the three types of banks. Moreover, they are located in countries with the low- est real GDP growth rate and the highest deposit insurance coverage ratio.\\nM.-W. Wu et al.

LC is the depend- ent variable and is the proxy for liquidity creation; CAPITAL is the capital ratio that is represented by either the LR or CAR. DWCA\\u200b equals one for a weak capital adequate bank and zero otherwise; DSCA equals one for a strong capital adequate bank and zero otherwise. When DWCA\\u200b and DSCA are equal to zero, the benchmark is banks with a low CAR. We examine the effects of DWCA\\u200b and DSCA by controlling for bank characteristics, macroeconomic variables, and institutional variables. Bank is the vector of bank finan- cial ratios. Institution is the vector of institutional variables. Then, Macro is the vector of macroeconomic variables. 훽j are unknown parameters, vi stands for bank fixed effects, ut denotes time fixed effects, and εi,t are random errors. The sample period covers 1996–2016. We examine H1 by summing the coefficients for the constant term and DWCA\\u200b (i.e., 훽0 + 훽1 ) and the coefficients for the constant term and DSCA (i.e., 훽0 + 훽2 ). H1 predicts that 𝛽1 > 𝛽2 . We examine H2 by checking 휕LC∕휕CAPITAL = 훽3 + 훽4DWCA + 훽5DSCA . Thus, the relationship between the capital and LC for a weak capital adequate bank is 훽3 + 훽4 (DWCA\\u200b = 1 and DSCA = 0), while the relationship for a strong capital adequate bank is 훽3 + 훽5 (DWCA\\u200b = 0 and DSCA = 1). H2 means that 훽3 + 훽4 is negative and 훽3 + 훽5 is positive. We include bank fixed effects to account for average differences over time across banks that the other exogenous variables do not capture and to reduce correlations across error terms. Time fixed effects are added to control for average differences in LC across years that are not captured by the other exogenous variables and to reduce serial correlation problems. All regressions are estimated with robust standard errors that are clustered by the bank to control for heteroskedasticity as well as possible correlation among the obser- vations of the same bank in different years. For easier reading, we provide the definitions of control variables in Table 4 and Appen- dix II.20 4 \\x07Data description We use commercial banks from 36 OECD countries, and our sample covers the period from 1996 to 2016. We have two sources for the financial data of our banks.

We exclude savings, cooperative, investment, internet, and central banks, as well as finan- cial and trust companies because our focus is on commercial banks only. The reason for excluding savings and cooperative banks is that the regulatory restrictions on their activities are quite different. Internet banks have dramatically different business models than deposi- tory banks. We exclude postal savings banks because their business models mainly transfer their deposits to large banks or buy sovereign debt securities to cover overhead costs. Postal savings banks also make fewer loans relative to their deposits, and their financial statements are still mixed with their postal businesses. We also exclude banks under liquidation. In addition to our selection of bank data, we follow some suggestions found in the litera- ture to minimize the possibilities of non-depository banks wrongly collected by the data- base. Berger and Bouwman (2009), Beltratti and Stulz (2012), and Erkens et al. (2012) use their selection criteria of banks with deposit-to-assets ratio above 20%, loan-to-assets ratio above 10%, and Tier 1 CAR below 20%.22 In addition, Berger and Bouwman (2009) delete observations with zero or negative equity capital. Thus, we exclude banks with an equity to total assets that is zero or negative. Finally, to avoid the impact of outliers, we winsorize all variables at the level of 1% and 99%. To ensure that our deletions do not cause Type I errors (e.g., it is a commercial bank but is wrongly removed), we check deleted banks by following the above rules. We find that our deletions are acceptable. For example, GE Capital Finance in the US is a finance company with a CAR of 59.22%, an LR of 65.03%, and a ROA of 5.47% in 2006 and is wrongly classified as a commercial bank in Bankscope. To cite another case, the Associ- ated Trust Company (NA) in the US, with a CAR of 149.62%, an LR of 83.23%, and a ROA of 30.6% in 2013, is also wrongly classified as a commercial bank. Bank One in Canada has a CAR of 840.88% and 962.18% in 2008 and 2009, respectively, as reflected in its liquidation. Bank of Baroda in New Zealand had a CAR of 452.70% in 2009 and is a subsidiary of India’s International Bank that has been officially registered as a bank since 2009. Japanese postal banks have CARs of up to 45%. Given the difficulty of examining the features of all banks, our criteria can facilitate the exclusion of non-commercial banks. The final sample comprises 274,354 bank-year observations in 36 OECD countries from 1996 to 2016. In this sample, we have 266,682 observations of strong capital adequate banks, 4,071 observations of weak capital adequate banks, and 3,601 observations of other banks. 5 \\x07Regression results 5.1 \\x07Baseline regression Table 5 presents the estimated results for Eq. (1). CAPITAL is measured by CAR in the left three columns and measured by LR in the right three columns. We first examine H1 in the third and sixth columns to illustrate our results because these columns include all the control variables. When CAR is the proxy for CAPITAL, the coeffi- cients for DWCA\\u200b and DSCA are 0.015 and −0.155, respectively. Both coefficients are signifi- cant, and their difference (i.e., the coefficient for DWCA\\u200b minus the coefficient for DSCA) is significantly positive (0.170, t statistic = 7.62), thus supporting H1. When LR is the proxy for CAPITAL, the results are similar to those when using CAR and further support H1. 22 Tier 1 CAR = (Tier 1 capital/risk-weighted assets) × 100%.\\nCapital and liquidity creation: does the capital adequacy… Table 5 Regression: baseline model LCi,t = β0 + β1 × DWCA\\u200b + β2 × DSCA + β3 × CAPITALi,t–1 + β4 × CAPITALi,t–1 × DWCA\\u200b + β5 × CAPITALi,t–1 × DSCA + β6 × Banki,t–1 + β7 × Institutioni,t–1 + β8 × Macroi,t–1 + vi + ut + εi,t. This table examines H1 and H2. Our dependent variable is bank size-adjusted liquidity creation measure. DWCA\\u200b is a dummy variable for weak capital adequate banks (CAR≧10% and LR < 5%); DSCA is a dummy variable for strong capital adequate banks (CAR≧10% and LR≧5%).

Wu et al. Hence, weak capital adequate banks take more risks through liquidity mismatches than strong capital adequate banks after controlling for all exogenous variables. We next discuss H2 by measuring the coefficients for the capital ratio and its interac- tion with dummy variables for our capital adequacy. When we use CAR to measure the capital ratio, the relationship between capital and LC is significantly negative. The coef- ficients for the interaction terms, CAPITAL × DWCA\\u200b and CAPITAL × DSCA, are significant at −0.146 and 0.236, respectively. We also calculate the total effects of CAR on LC for weak and strong capital adequate banks, which are 훽3 + 훽4DWCA and 훽3 + 훽5DSCA , respec- tively. These values are −0.171 and 0.211, respectively, and both are significant (t sta- tistics = −4.79 and 7.60, respectively). The results indicate that weak and strong capital adequate banks strengthen and mitigate the negative relationship between CAR and LC, respectively. Finally, weak capital adequate banks have a negative relationship between capital and LC, while strong capital adequate banks have a positive relationship. The dif- ference between these two effects is significantly negative (t statistic = −9.64) and thus supports our hypothesis that the weak capital adequate bank has a stronger negative rela- tionship between CAPITAL and LC than the strong capital adequate bank. These results support H2 in that the weak capital adequate bank supports the financial fragility view while the strong capital adequate bank supports the view of risk absorption. These results align with our presumption that the weak capital adequate bank has a less cautious attitude toward risk than the strong capital adequate bank. When LR is the proxy for the capital ratio, the coefficients for 훽3 , 훽4 , and 훽5 are −0.027, −3.389, and 0.106, respectively, and all are significant. The total effects of CAPI- TAL on LC are significantly negative ( −3.416, t statistic = −8.91) and positive (0.079, t statis- tic = 3.15) for weak and strong capital adequate banks, respectively. Hence, the results support H2 regardless of the capital ratios. Given that the relationship between the capital ratio and LC contrasts between the two types of banks, mixing them may provide incorrect inferences. We also reach the same statistical conclusion on the coefficients for the interactions ( 훽4 ) of weak capital adequate banks using either CAR or LR. However, their economic signifi- cance is different. A one-standard-deviation decrease in CAR and LR is accompanied by $0.52 billion and $1.06 billion increases in LC, respectively. The latter amount is over two times larger than the former. While CAR has more room to be manipulated than LR (Mari- athasan and Merrouche 2014), we draw a conclusion based on LR that the weak capital adequate bank has a strong negative relationship between capital and LC, which thus indi- cates a less cautious attitude toward risk. By contrast, the coefficients for the interactions and the total effects of CAPITAL on LC differ relatively little for strong capital adequate banks. This result aligns with the risk-absorption view, as a bank consistently focuses on its capital ratios and conducts LC accordingly. The results of the control variables are all consistent with our expectations. Banks with large assets, high ROA, and high cost-to-income ratio engage in more LC. Banks in coun- tries with low market concentration, few restrictions, and weak economic growth conduct more LC. 5.2 \\x07Considering the effect of bank size: big and non‑big banks Following Distinguin et al. (2013), we divide our sample into big (more than $1 billion in assets) and non-big banks (less than $1 billion in assets). We have 26,196 bank-year obser- vations in the big bank subsample and 248,158 in the non-big bank subsample. We then classify the banks into four types: big with weak capital adequacy (Big WCA), non-big\\nCapital and liquidity creation: does the capital adequacy… with weak capital adequacy (NonBig WCA), big with strong capital adequacy (Big SCA), and non-big with strong capital adequacy (NonBig SCA). Panels A and B of Table 6 present the estimation results using the big and non-big sub- samples, respectively. Panel C shows the results of the Chow test. In each subsample, we discuss H1 and H2 by using the third column because it includes all control variables. First, we discuss H1. In the big-bank sample, the coefficients for the two dummy variables (i.e., DWCA\\u200b and DSCA) are 0.074 and −0.146, respectively. They are significant at the 1% level, and their difference of 0.220 (at the bottom of Panel A) is significant at the 1% level (t sta- tistic = 5.59). These findings hold in the sixth column, where LR is a proxy for CAPITAL. In the non-big bank sample, the coefficients for DWCA\\u200b and DSCA are 0.001 and −0.006, respectively. They are significant at the 1% level, and their difference of 0.006 (bottom of Panel B) is significant at the 1% level (t statistic = 3.81). Thus, the results support H1 regardless of bank size. From Panel C, the Chow test shows that the coefficient of DWCA\\u200b for big banks is significantly higher than that of DWCA\\u200b for non-big banks (t statistic = 9.54), and the coefficient of DSCA for big banks is significantly higher than that of DSCA for non- big banks (t statistic = 31.84). These findings indicate that big weak capital adequate banks create the most liquidity, whereas non-big strong capital adequate banks create the least liquidity. Second, we examine H2. In the big-bank sample, the total effects of CAPITAL on LC are −0.919 (t statistic = −4.21) and 0.144 (t statistic = 2.40) in WCA and SCA banks, respectively (bottom of Panel A). Thus, CAPITAL has a greater positive effect on LC in SCA banks. The results are similar when we adopt LR as an alternative measure for CAPI- TAL. Similarly, in the non-big bank sample, the total effects of CAPITAL on LC are −0.014 (t statistic = −3.41) and 0.00005 (t statistic = 4.38) in WCA and SCA banks, respectively (bottom of Panel B). Thus, the results support H2 regardless of bank size. From the Chow test for the difference between two total effects (Panel C), the total effect of big banks with WCA is significantly lower than that of non-big banks with WCA (t statistic = −3.19), whereas the total effect of big banks with SCA is significantly higher than that of non-big banks with SCA (t statistic = 7.08). Thus, big weak capital adequate banks have the most negative relationship between capital and LC, whereas big strong capital adequate banks have the most positive capital and LC linkage.23 Using the big and non-big bank subsamples, our results are similar to those of our base- line model and support the two hypotheses. Hence, we successfully infer the correlation between risk cautiousness and liquidity mismatch. 6 \\x07Robust testing 6.1 \\x07Endogeneity I: selection bias consideration A bank’s choice to be either weak or strong capital adequate may not be random but rather a deliberate decision by managers to self-select their preferred options that thus lead to selection 23 Bhagat et al. (2015) find a positive relationship between size and risk-taking in US financial institutions. Bolton et al. (2007) and Laeven and Levine (2007) point out that large and complex banks that engage in multiple activities (e.g., combining lending and trading) suffer from increased agency problems and poor corporate governance, which can translate into systemic risk. Altunbas et al. (2017) show that large banks undertook aggressive credit growth policies in the presence of housing bubbles and then suffered more after Lehman’s default. Laeven et al. (2016) corroborate that systemic risk grows with bank size.\\nM.-W. Wu et al.

Wu et al. bias. For instance, Berger et al. (2008) find that publicly traded bank holding companies in the US actively manage their capital ratios, set target capital levels substantially above well-capital- ized regulatory minima, and make rapid adjustments toward their targets. Alali and Jaggi (2011) also report that banks with portfolios owning high-risk assets use more loan loss provisions to manage reported earnings as well as capital ratios compared to banks with portfolios of low- risk assets. In this subsection, we use Heckman’s (1978) two-stage method to resolve the self- selection bias. The first stage estimates two determinant equations for weak and strong capital adequate banks by using the multivariate probit model. We next obtain the two inverse Mills ratios (IMR) from each multivariate probit regres- sion. We further assume that a bank will consider its financial characteristics, business structures, regulatory regimes, and economic situations in the previous period when deter- mining its capital to be either weakly or strongly adequate. Hence, we choose the lagged two-period rates of change for CAPITAL, TA, ROA, NPLr, CostInc, Cap_Reg, Restrict, Conc, and GDPg as determinant variables for DWCA\\u200b and DSCA. As Lewbel (1997) notes, this linear transformation of exogenous variables could be a valid instrument. The second stage uses the two IMRs as additional explanatory variables in Eq. (1) (Hamilton and Nickerson 2003; Li and Prabhala 2007; Wu and Shen 2013).24 If the coef- ficient for IMR is significant, then a significant correlation exists between the error terms obtained in the two stages of the Heckman model (Magableh et al. 2011). An insignificant effect for IMR on the dependent variables indicates that no sample selection bias exists. Panel A of Table 7 presents the results for the first-stage regressions. In the first two columns, with CAR as the proxy for CAPITAL, we find that a bank is more likely to be weak or strong capital adequate when it shows rapid increases in CAR and TA. Increases in ROA and Cap_Reg significantly raise the probability of being a strong capital adequate bank. However, an rise in Conc positively and negatively relates to the likelihood of being a strong and a weak capital adequate banks, respectively. The last two columns with LR as the proxy for CAPITAL also show similar results. It is noteworthy that the Wald χ2 tests for the two sets of regressions are significant, which corroborate that for both equations (i.e., DWCA\\u200b relative to other banks and DSCA relative to other banks), at least one of the predic- tors’ regression coefficients is not equal to zero. Panel B of Table 7 presents the estimated results for the second-stage regressions with the two IMRs as additional independent variables. The results are similar to those in Table 5 and provide support for H1 and H2. First, we discuss H1 by using the third column. The coefficients for the two dummy variables (i.e., DWCA\\u200b and DSCA) are 0.054 and −0.097, respectively, and both are significant at the 5% level. Thus, the results support H1. Second, we examine H2. The relationship between CAPITAL and LC is significantly negative, and the coefficients for CAPITAL × DWCA\\u200b and CAPITAL × DSCA are −0.572 and 24 Wu and Shen (2013) suggest that IMR does not have a significant ‘‘economic’’ interpretation but an ‘‘econometric’’ interpretation. We add IMR, because it is the correct term for self-selection bias and is pro- duced by the first-stage regression of the Heckman two-stage model. Accordingly, the significance of the IMR coefficient justifies that the bias is removed. This econometric background was developed by the Nobel Prize winner, Heckman (1978) and is widely documented in many econometric books, such as Greene (2003). Application studies typically cite Heckman’s work to justify the validity of empirical models. Vari- ous applied studies add simple and mixed economic and econometric reasoning.

This table examines H1 and H2. We deal with selection bias of DWCA\\u200b and DSCA by adopting Heckman’s (1978) two-stage method. The determinant variables in the multi- variate probit regression is (lnWi,t−lnWi,t–1)i,t–2, where W denotes CAPITAL, TA, ROA, NPLr, CostInc, GDPg, Conc, Restrict, and Cap_Reg. IMR1 and IMR2 are inverse Mills ratios for weak capital adequate banks and strong capital adequate banks, respectively. Our dependent variable is bank-size adjusted liquidity creation measure. DWCA\\u200b is a dummy variable for weak capital adequate banks (CAR≧10% and LR < 5%); DSCA is a dummy variable for strong capital adequate banks (CAR≧10% and LR≧5%). The con- trol variables are defined in Table 4. All regressions are run with both bank fixed effects and time fixed effects. t statistics based on robust standard errors clustered by bank are in parentheses. \\xadH0: DWCA\\u200b−DSCA = 0 is null hypothesis for H1. \\xadH0: (1 + DWCA\\u200b) × CAPITAL = 0 and \\xadH0: (1 + DSCA) × CAPITAL = 0 are null hypotheses for H2. The superscripts *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively\\n1.900, respectively, and are significant. The total effect of CAPITAL on LC for weak and strong capital adequate banks are −0.628 (t statistic = −2.31) and 1.844 (t statistic = 3.65), respectively, and the difference between these two effects is significantly negative (t statis- tic = −5.90). The results are similar when we adopt LR as an alternative measure for CAPI- TAL. Thus, H2 is supported. In sum, considering the self-selection bias, our results are similar to those of our base- line model and support the primary hypotheses. Hence, we successfully infer the linkage between risk cautiousness and liquidity mismatch. 6.2 \\x07Endogeneity II: endogenous capital ratios  acknowledge that the capital ratio and LC are mainly decided simultaneously. Although our study does not imply a causal relationship, we use lagged capital ratios to mitigate simultaneity concerns in our main analysis. However, to directly overcome the case where the capital ratios may be endogenous, we adopt the instrumental variables in the two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression to obtain consistent estimates (). In the procedure, we have three estimations in the first stage because the capital ratio and its interactions with the two dummies for our capital adequacy, CAPI- TAL × DWCA\\u200b and CAPITAL × DSCA, are endogenous (). We regress the above three capital-relevant variables on instrumental variables to obtain three predic- tors and then regress LC on these predictors and control variables in the second stage to acquire consistent estimates of the parameters. We use the income tax rate a bank has to pay () and the dividend payout ratio a bank pays to its shareholders () as instrumental variables for the lagged capital ratio. Stud- ies show that capital accumulation is relevant to both income tax (; ) and dividend policy (; ; ), but they do not find that the two variables directly affect LC. A bank that pays lower income taxes due to a higher tax shield from interest payments has a higher capital ratio, and a bank with higher dividend payouts faces a lower capital ratio. Thus,  and  could be valid instrumental variables.  show the results of the first-stage regressions for the endogenous variables CAPITAL, CAPITAL × DWCA\\u200b, and CAPITAL × DSCA, respectively. The instrumental variables,  and , have significantly negative effects on capital ratios and the interaction terms in most regressions. These results are consistent with our prediction that the tax benefit of debt and the cost benefit of a dividend payout may out- weigh safety and soundness considerations and induce banks to hold lower capital ratios.  presents the results of the second-stage regression using the pre- dicted values of endogenous variables from the first-stage regressions. Since all regressions pass the Cragg–Donald F-test and Hansen J test, we corroborate that our instruments are exogenous and not weak. Similar to the results in the baseline model, our two hypotheses are fully supported when we use the instrumental variable method. 6.3 \\x07Different areas We now look to reduce country heteroskedasticity by restricting the country samples to a similar region.

Thus, the capital ratios of banks in these three countries may not reflect the banks’ decisions, but rather the authorities’ requirements. After removing these three countries, our results still support H1 and H2. We next consider banks in Western European countries (Panel B), because most weak capital adequate banks in Europe are in these countries. The results fully support H1 and H2. Since the US sample consists of 83% of the total observations, we must test whether the higher percentage of US banks affects our baseline result. Hence, we re-estimate Eq. (1) using only US banks, and the results still support H1 and H2 (Panel C). Combining the findings in Table 5 (baseline result) and Panels A (excluding US banks) and C (US banks only) of Table 9, we conclude that a large number of US banks has limited, if any, effect on our baseline result. The weak capital adequate banks in Luxembourg and Japan comprise around 34% of all weak capital adequate banks that did not implement the minimum LR requirement before Basel III. To confirm that the baseline results are not driven by the higher percent- age of these two countries’ weak capital adequate banks, we conduct an additional test that excludes banks from the US, Canada, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Japan.25 The results in Panel D of Table 9 validate the robustness of our main findings.

Wu et al. 6.4 \\x07Different cutoffs for CAR and LR As Basel I suggests, a well-capitalized bank should have CAR and an LR above 8% and 4%, respectively. Hence, as a robustness check, we adopt these criteria to classify weak and strong capital adequate banks and re-estimate the baseline model. The results in Table 10 also support our two hypotheses. 6.5 \\x07Different definitions of LR Table 11 presents the estimated results by replacing our LR (equity/total assets) with another LR (Tier 1 capital/total assets). Again, the findings support H1 and H2. 6.6 \\x07The impact of Basel III’s LR requirement This subsection further examines whether the announcement of Basel III’s LR require- ment affects the relationship between capital and LC in the two types of banks. We use 2011 as the cutoff year to investigate the effect of LR requirement, as the Basel Com- mittee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published its first version of the Basel III LR rule on December 16, 2010. Table 12 displays the estimation results of Eq. (1) for the sample before 2010 (Panel A) and after 2011 (Panel B). The results support H1 and H2 in both subsamples. It is interesting to note that the weak capital adequate banks conduct fewer LC and have a flatter LC–capital relationship after than before Basel III’s LR announcement. One possible reason is that Basel III’s LR requirement alleviates the capital adequacy problem to some extent, thus making the effect of the weak capital adequate banks smaller. 6.7 \\x07Effect of deposit insurance As Berger and Bouwman (2009) note, the financial fragility effect suggested by Dia- mond and Rajan (2000, 2001) depends on the extent of deposit coverage. To corrobo- rate whether our baseline results change after considering different deposit insurance schemes, we additionally consider the variable CovLim in our regression framework. CovLim, an index developed by Demirgüç-Kunt et al. (2015), denotes deposit insurance coverage limit divided by GDP per capita. We adopt this variable to capture the vari- ability in deposit insurance policies across the 36 OECD countries. Panel A of Table 13 presents the results of adding the new index, CovLim, as the independent variable in the baseline model. Our two hypotheses are again fully supported. It is also noteworthy that banks in a country with lower coverage limits tend to create more liquidity. To further account for differences in deposit insurance coverage, we separately test the baseline results for the bank observations with CovLim both less than the 25th per- centile and greater than the 75th percentile, and the results appear in Panels B and C of Table 13, respectively. By examining the two extreme cases, the findings still support H1 and H2. In addition, to comprehensively control for unobserved, exogenous country- level factors, we add country fixed effects to our estimations in Table 13.\\nCapital and liquidity creation: does the capital adequacy… Table 11 Robustness: different LR LCi,t = β0 + β1 × DWCA\\u200b + β2 × DSCA + β3 × CAPITALi,t–1 + β4 × CAPITALi,t–1 × DWCA\\u200b + β5 × CAPITALi,t–1 × DSCA + β6 × Banki,t–1 + β7 × Institutioni,t–1 + β8 × Macroi,t–1 + vi + ut + εi,t.

Our dependent variable is bank-size adjusted liquidity creation measure.

We combine CAR and LR, which aligns more with the spirit of the revised capital adequacy framework in Basel III. We define the strengths of capital adequacy of a bank by examining whether its CAR and LR meet the regulatory criterion of being well-capitalized or not. We examine the effect of our capital adequacy framework and posit that a strong and a weak capital adequate banks have different risk attitudes affecting their LC. Using data on 18,247 commercial banks in 36 OECD countries from 1996 to 2016, we obtain three major findings. First, weak capital adequate banks create more liquid- ity than strong capital adequate banks, indicating that the former has a less cautious attitude toward risk than the former. Second, weak capital adequate banks have negative relationship between capital and LC, whereas strong capital adequate banks show the opposite. We adopt the views of financial fragility and risk absorption to explain this finding. Third, our capital adequacy framework is valid, because it affects LC differently than the traditional capital adequacy framework with only CAR. We further extend our study by considering the size effect. Results show that the view of financial fragility could explain the result for banks that are big and have weak capital adequacy. These banks create more liquidity than those with strong capital ade- quacy due to their lower risk cautiousness. Our robustness tests consider several problems, which include self-selection bias, endogenous capital ratios, different areas, alternative cutoff points of well capitalization, an alternative proxy for LR, the announcement effect of Basel III’s LR requirement, and differences in deposit insurance coverage. All of the results support H1 and H2. Our findings echo Basel III. Basel III introduced a simple leverage ratio to complement CAR to ensure the soundness of banks, thereby reducing excessive risk activities such as liquidity mismatches. However, this risk reduction may lessen major banks’ function of liquidity creation and adversely impact financing within the economic system.

Appendix II: The definitions of control variables Bank is the vector of variables for bank characteristics. We include the return on assets (ROA), nonperforming loans ratio (NPLr), cost-to-income ratio (CostInc), and natural logarithmic transformation of total assets (lnTA) to control for basic bank characteris- tics. We adopt the ROA as a proxy for a bank’s profitability. A bank that earns high prof- its may maintain its high liquidity creation. When a bank has high profits through man- agers with better ability, the bank creates more liquidity and consequently takes more risks (Andreou et al. 2016). NPLr denotes the ratio of a bank’s nonperforming loans to total assets. A bank with lower-quality assets reduces its liquidity creation (Horváth et al. 2014). CostInc measures a bank’s efficiency because efficiencies may alleviate its liquidity creation (Barth et al. 2004). We also control for the size effect by adding lnTA\\nCapital and liquidity creation: does the capital adequacy… because size may affect capital. In addition, large and complex banks take on excessive risks in the expectation of government bailouts (Farhi and Tirole 2012; Laeven et al. 2016). This inclusion ensures that the results are not affected by bank size. Specifically, the effect of capital likely differs in size in our study. Thus, we also robustly investigate the effects of our capital adequacy by using big and non-big bank samples. We remove country heteroskedasticity by considering institutional and macroeco- nomic variables. Institution is a vector of market and regulation variables that accounts for different market conditions and bank supervision across countries. We first consider Cap_Reg and Restrict from Barth et al. (2006, 2008) because more stringent regulation may reduce a bank’s risk-taking. Cap_Reg measures the level of regulatory stringency for capital that incorporates the Overall Capital Stringency and the Initial Capital Stringency. This proxy represents the extent of the regulatory amount of the capital that banks must have relative to specific guidelines and the extent to which the source of funds counts as reg- ulatory capital. Distinguin et al. (2013) use this variable to control for possible country effects. Stringent capital regulation encourages banks to maintain high capital. Restrict measures the regulatory restrictions on banking activities in securities, insurance, and real estate. Shen and Chang (2006) find that the effect of restriction indexes on account- ing returns is negative, except for the restriction on real estate. Then, we consider Conc, which measures the degree of concentration in the banking market with the ratio of the total assets of the three largest banks to those of all banks in a country. A low Conc indicates high competition. Studies find that competition reduces liquidity creation by lowering the risk-absorption capacity of banks (Horvath et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2019) or boosts liquidity creation by spurring financial innovation and improving efficiency (Boot and Thakor 2000; Laeven et al. 2015). Furthermore, enhanced competition stimu- lates the demand for loans by alleviating financing obstacles (Beck et al. 2004). Macro is a macroeconomic vector for the growth rate of real GDP (GDPg). Table 4 lists the detailed definitions of the variables. Appendix III: Definition of our liquidity creation variable LC = [0.5 × Illiquid Assets + 0 × Semiliquid Assets + ( −0.5) × Liquid Assets + 0.5 × Liquid Liabilities + 0 × Semiliquid Liabilities + ( −0.5) × (Illiquid Liabilities + Equity) + 0.5 × Illiq- uid Activities + 0 × Semiliquid Activities + ( −0.5) × Liquid Activities]/Total Assets. This table explains our classification of on- and off-balance sheet items to calculate liquidity creation measure.

As supervisory leverage constraints and specific characteris- tics force banks to increase LR, we thus investigate official regulations and review stud- ies in the literature. Though beyond the scope of this study, we only use this information to identify our robust sample, which excludes countries with leverage constraints in our sample period, and to control the characteristics in our empirical regressions. First, we check bank capital regulations. To our best knowledge, only the US (in 1981; see Alfriend 1988, Wall 1989, Davison 1997, and Aggarwal and Jacques 1998, 2001), Canada (in 1980; see Crawford et al. 2009), and Switzerland (in 2009; see FINMA 2011) used their leverage constraints, then turned to Basel III’s LR require- ments, but also delayed implementation. The US introduced a simple leverage ratio of primary capital to average total assets in 1981, then proposed a supplementary leverage ratio in 2013 and planned to implement it after 2021 (Scott and Labonte 2023). Canada set a formal limit of 30 on the assets-to-capital multiple for large banks in 1980 and adopted Basel III’s LR in 2023 (Moody’s Analytics 2022). Switzerland adopted its LR as a risk-neutral backstop measure back in 2008 under the “too-big-to-fail” policy and then redefined it based on Basel III (Jordan 2011). Banks in other countries, however, did not have leverage constraints before Basel III and did not implement Basel III leverage during our sample period. For example, LR for EU banks was not introduced outright as a binding requirement, but as a Pillar II measure at the discretion of national regulators (Sabel 2013). The EU then introduced 3% Basel III LR in 2013 but postponed implementation to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic (ECB 2021). For non-EU countries, the UK published the LR requirement in 2012 and activated it in 2017 (ESRB 2016). Japan requires banks to report Basel III-based ratios starting from 2024 (Long 2022). Australia has mandated deposit-taking institutions to report their LR since 2015 and aligned with BCBS’s implementation in 2022. Norway’s LR requirement for banks is 5% and has become effective since 2017 (Lambert 2019). South Korea applied its LR requirements in 2018 (Lee and Lee 2016). Second, we investigate the literature on bank and country characteristics and how they affect LR. We use some of their control variables in our empirical tests, but doing so beyond the scope of this paper.\\nCapital and liquidity creation: does the capital adequacy… For bank characteristics, Hoque and Pour (2018) take 57 global countries and find that highly leveraged banks have large asset sizes and take high risk but have low profit- ability. Oliveira and Raposo (2021) note that in European countries, highly leveraged private banks have large asset sizes but low profits and risk. For country characteristics, Hoque and Pour (2018) state that banks in countries with higher tax advantages, credi- tor rights, deposit insurance, and bankruptcy crises take on more leverage, while those bound by common law are less leveraged. We also discuss some special characteristics unique to a specific country, although unsuitable for our cross-country study. Giordana and Schumacher (2011) argue that Luxembourg’s banks expand their balance sheets by increasing deposits or selling secu- rities, obtaining support from their parent firms, or taking on large off-balance sheet exposures. Fukao (2003) finds that Japanese banks with high CARs often use historical cost bookkeeping of equity portfolios, under-reserving against bad loans, and subordi- nated debts from friendly life insurance companies.
